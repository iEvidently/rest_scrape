                  Cyprus is allowing entry from two sets of countries of origin,
                  according to epidemiological criteria. The categories are: i)
                  Category A Countries – Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus,
                  Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Greece,
                  Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Norway,
                  Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland, and ii) Category B Countries
                  – Israel, Poland, Romania. As of June 20, 2020, persons flying
                  from Category A countries face no restrictions; people
                  traveling from Category B countries are required to have a PCR
                  test done at the source country, 72 hours prior to their
                  arrival. Travel from countries which are not present in either
                  of the two categories is allowed only in exceptional cases,
                  and after receiving prior approval by the Cyprus government.
                  This is also the case for transit travel via these countries.

                  Citizens and foreigners with Macedonian residence permits,
                  including students and diplomats, will need to show a negative
                  COVID-19 test no older than 72 hours. Without a test, they
                  will need to go to a state-provided quarantine facility, where
                  they will have the chance to take a test, leave the facility,
                  and self-isolate for 14 days assuming the test is negative. If
                  the test is positive, they will be required to spend 14-day in
                  quarantine. The facilities are usually hotels located
                  throughout the country. Foreigners who do not have a residency
                  permit remain barred from entry unless simply transiting
                  through the country. If only transiting, they will have to
                  leave the country no later than five hours after entry, and
                  are not allowed to leave areas adjoining the highways.

                  Starting from April 8 until April 22, 2020, passengers of
                  Chinese nationality taking a scheduled flight to China from 26

                  and Thailand should make daily report on personal information,
                  health status and travel history through an APP in WeChat
                  International version. After April 22, 2020, passengers should
                  make daily report 14 days before the date of boarding. Russia
                  has been added to this list since April 15, 2020. All
                  international flights to Beijing are currently being
                  redirected to 12 other cities. Once those with symptoms or
                  identified as or suspicious of carrying the virus have been
                  identified, other passengers will then be able to travel to
                  Beijing, although significant delay can be expected. Once
                  those identified passengers complete the 14-day mandatory
                  quarantine in these other cities and get a negative test
                  result, if they travel to Beijing on the same or following
                  day, they will not be subject to further quarantine in
                  Beijing. Otherwise, another 14-day mandatory quarantine will
                  be required upon arrival in Beijing. Almost all arriving
                  travelers from overseas will be subject to 14-day quarantine
                  requirement with exceptions in certain regions where longer
                  quarantine period is required. All inbound travelers to
                  Shenzhen shall be subject to 14-day mandatory quarantine at
                  government designated facilities. All inbound travelers
                  arriving in Shanghai from any country will be subject to
                  14-day mandatory quarantine and nucleic acid test . Additional
                  domestic rules may apply to multi-city travel (e.g., overseas
                  arrival in Shanghai then onward transit to Beijing). "Fast
                  track" entry is allowed for business travelers from South
                  Korea to 10 Chinese locations, including Shanghai and
                  Liaoning, Shandong, Jiangsu, and Anhui provinces, where such
                  travelers will be subject to one- or two-days quarantine
                  instead of a normal 14-day quarantine. Approved travelers from
                  South Korea will have to undergo testing in South Korea within
                  72 hours of travel and undergo testing again during a one or
                  two-day quarantine in China (PRC).

                  Effective April 8, 2020, Wuhan Tianhe International Airport
                  will resume operation except flights to and from Beijing.
                  Travelers arriving in Beijing from high-risk areas in China
                  (PRC) will be subject to 14-day quarantine, while no
                  quarantine requirement for travelers from low-risk areas if
                  they can provide a green QR code. Employers are still required
                  to report to the landlord or local neighborhood council about
                  any employees arriving from overseas and high-risk areas in
                  China (PRC). Effective, June 16, 2020, controls and transport
                  restrictions in Beijing have been expanded. Districts such as
                  Fengtai, Chaoyang, Daxing, and Mentougou are placed under “war
                  time” restrictions. In most other cities, domestic arrival
                  will not be subject to mandatory quarantine if they can
                  provide a green QR code. Beginning June 8, 2020, essential
                  business travel from Singapore under a fast-track arrangement
                  is allowed.

                  Azerbaijan has temporarily suspended the issuance of e-visas.
                  Foreign nationals whose visas are due to expire by April 30,

                  60-day visa extension. Inter-regional travel has resumed.
                  International passenger traffic remains suspended through July
                  1, 2020. The restrictions do not apply to emergency and cargo
                  flights. Effective June 14 to June 16, 2020, a 30-hour

                  All scheduled international commercial passenger services will
                  remain closed until June 30, 2020. Until then, no
                  international aircraft will be allowed to disembark passengers
                  (including citizens) in India, with the following exception.
                  From May 7, 2020, the Indian government has been evacuating
                  stranded Indian citizens in a phased manner from several
                  countries on special flights. On May 22, 2020, the Government
                  of India announced that the following categories of Overseas
                  Citizens of India (OCI) cardholders may travel to India on
                  special evacuation flights. (1) Minor children who are born to
                  Indian nationals abroad and who hold valid OCI cards; (2) OCI
                  cardholders who wish to come to India on account of family
                  emergencies; (3) University students who are OCI cardholders
                  (not minors) and whose parents are Indian citizens living in
                  India; and (4) Couples where one spouse is an OCI cardholder
                  and the other is an Indian national and who permanently reside
                  in India. The Indian government is permitting entry of foreign
                  nationals with a fresh or renewed business visa as of June 15,
                  2020. Authorized travelers include those with the managerial
                  and technical expertise required by a foreign entity located
                  in India or an Indian entity providing a letter of invitation,
                  others include Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) cardholders and
                  foreign nationals related to OCI cardholders or Indian
                  citizens. Family members of those in India with diplomatic,
                  official, or UN/international organizations visas are also
                  permitted to enter India. Such travelers must approach Indian
                  consulates for fresh visas regardless of previous visa status
                  and may enter the country via non-scheduled flights due to an
                  ongoing ban on commercial international passenger flights
                  through June 30, 2020. Anyone who qualifies for an evacuation
                  flight must register with the Indian consular post in their
                  jurisdiction and only travel to India on the designated
                  flight. While there is no specific announcement regarding
                  departure of flights from India, they are virtually at a
                  standstill. Indian officials are maintaining a ban on
                  travelers from Afghanistan, the EU, the European Free Trade
                  Association, Malaysia, Philippines, Turkey, and the United
                  Kingdom.

                  Several countries such as Germany, Israel, Malaysia, and the
                  United States, amongst others, have obtained permission from
                  the Indian government with evacuation flights having left
                  India to support their citizens back to their respective home
                  countries. Other countries, such as the UK and Singapore, are
                  working with the Indian Government and airlines by clearing
                  flights to leave India. All visa services (excluding
                  in-country registration, visa extension, and other in-country
                  services) remain suspended until further notice. Visas of all

                  or stipulations of stay which have, or are set, to expire
                  between February 1, 2020 and until such time the temporary ban
                  on international commercial passenger services is not lifted
                  by the Government of India (June 30, 2020, as per the current
                  travel advisory), will be extended for a period of 30 days
                  from June 30, 2020. Visa-on-arrival suspended for nationals of
                  Japan and South Korea. Travelers (once international flights
                  are permitted to land) who arrive from or have been in Italy
                  or South Korea with a visa issued after March 5, 2020 by India
                  will only be allowed to enter if they have a health

                  China (PRC) in the past 14 days are not allowed to transit or

                  Korea. Korean visas issued by the Wuhan Consulate in the Hubei
                  Province are invalidated. A visa is required to transit
                  through South Korea for nationals of China (PRC). Nationals of
                  Japan who do not hold a Korean visa issued on or after March
                  9, 2020 will not be allowed entry. Foreign travelers not
                  entering Korea are allowed to transfer without a visa unless:
                  they departed from China, they have been to Hubei in the last
                  14 days, or their passports or visa were issued in Hubei.

                  Effective June 1, 2020, ARC holders (with limited exemptions)
                  must obtain re-entry permission before departing South Korea.

                  short-term consular visas issued on or before April 5, 2020
                  will be invalidated; this does not apply to C-4 short-term
                  employment visas or long-term work visas. ARCs of foreign
                  residents (with some exception) are automatically extended for
                  3 months from the current expiry date, so long as as the
                  holder is in South Korea as of April 9 and the ARC expiry date
                  falls between April 9 and May 31, 2020 (both dates inclusive).
                  Visas issued to nationals of Japan (at Korean Diplomatic
                  Missions in Japan) before March 9, 2020 are invalidated. This
                  does not apply to visas issued outside Japan. Such visas
                  remain valid. Visa-free entry to Jeju Island is temporarily
                  suspended to all foreign nationals. Visa-free and visa-waiver
                  programs have been halted with countries that have entry bans
                  for South Korean citizens. The restriction impacts travelers
                  from 90 countries, including Australia, Canada, and most
                  European nations.

                  Nationals and residents returning to Taiwan are subject to
                  14-day home quarantine. Effective April 21, 2020, inbound
                  travelers who have visited Southeast Asia in the last 14 days
                  (starting 00:00 Taipei Standard Time on April 7, 2020) should
                  complete the COVID-19 Health Declaration and Home Quarantine
                  Notice and confirm if their residence satisfies the home
                  quarantine requirements before boarding. Travelers visiting
                  from low-risk areas must quarantine for five days, while those
                  traveling from medium-risk destinations must quarantine for
                  seven days at government-designated facilities. Travelers will
                  also have to pay for another COVID-19 test before their
                  release from confinement. Graduating university students from
                  low-risk locations are permitted to return to the island. As

                  Thailand, Mongolia, and Bhutan as low risk and South Korea,
                  Japan, Malaysia, and Singapore as medium risk. Such inbound
                  travelers should stay at a quarantine hotel after entering
                  Taiwan if they live with people who are 65 years old or older,

                  Effective June 1, 2020, inter-city travel ban will be lifted.
                  Suspension of the majority of international commercial flights
                  into Turkey, with some airlines appearing to operate limited
                  flights. Turkish airlines banned international flights until
                  June 10, 2020. Effective June 1, 2020, domestic flight ban
                  will be lifted with some airlines operating limited flights
                  from Istanbul to Ankara, Izmir, Antalya, and Trabzon. Flights
                  to other cities expected to gradually resume. Despite several
                  official announcements made during the month of June, it is
                  still unclear whether an entry ban may be imposed on foreign
                  nationals who have been unable to exit Turkey by the
                  expiration date of their current status due to COVID-19.
                  Consular posts around the world are either allowing visa
                  filings by post or bonded courier (i.e., not in-person),
                  restricting access to limited appointments, or fully closed to
                  visa services. Turkey's borders with Azerbaijan, Bulgaria,
                  Greece, Iran, and Iraq are closed indefinitely, freight trucks
                  are still permitted to cross, subject to health screening.
                  International flights in Turkey will resume from June 18,
                  2020. Turkish Airlines (TK) will fly to and from Germany,
                  Switzerland, Austria, Netherlands, Denmark, and Sweden.

                  Effective June 6 to June 20, 2020, a 15:00-06:00 curfew is
                  imposed in in the city of Jeddah, Mecca Province.
                  International flights are suspended until further notice.
                  Residence visa renewal process can be done online and it is
                  still as normal. Visitors on an expired visit visa or
                  temporary visa may apply for an extension. Saudi Arabia
                  Directorate General of Passports announced that it will allow
                  the service of extending visit visas of all kinds for visitors
                  who are inside the Kingdom, in line with the government's
                  decision to suspend all international flights. Complete
                  lockdowns are in effect in Riyadh, Tabuk, Dammam, Dhahran,
                  Hofuf, and across Jeddah, Taif, and Khobar governorates until
                  further notice. Effective May 11, 2020, the lockdown measures
                  in Samtah and Al-Dayer governorates in the Jazan Region would
                  be lifted. Effective May 31, 2020, a nationwide curfew of
                  20:00-06:00 has been implemented.

                  All Macao residents who have been in Schengen Area, the United

                  South Korea, Japan, Iran, and New Zealand in the past 14 days
                  are subject to quarantine for 14 days. Residents and travelers
                  who visited Hong Kong, Taiwan, and other countries are allowed
                  to self-isolate at home. As of 14 June, 2020, Macau and Zhuhai
                  have eased quarantine requirements for some travel. Officials
                  are permitting Macau citizens that live in Zhuhai with
                  residency permits to cross the border without quarantine
                  requirements, after applying for an exemption. Macau teachers
                  and students residing in Zhuhai do not have to apply for the
                  exemption. Travelers must receive approval from health
                  authorities via an online application and undergo a nucleic
                  acid test for COVID-19 within 48 hours of traveling to Zhuhai.
                  People receiving approval can travel across the border an
                  unlimited number of times within seven days but cannot leave
                  Guangdong. Effective June 14, 2020, Macau has halted
                  applications for residents applying for a quarantine exemption
                  to enter Zhuhai, Guangdong Province. Macau is requiring
                  travelers who have visited Beijing within 14 days of arrival
                  to quarantine at designated locations for two weeks as of June
                  17, 2020.

                  Government offices and ministries closed until May 31, 2020.
                  Effective May 31, 2020, the 24-hour curfew will be replaced by
                  a nightly 18:00-06:00 curfew. However, the 24-hour curfew will
                  remain in force in Meedan Hawally, Khaitan, Farwaniya, Jaleeb
                  Al-Shukoukh, and Maboula until further notice. Per the US
                  State Department, Kuwait Ministerial Decision 288 dated March
                  26, 2020 gives the option to foreign nationals, including US
                  citizens, who, as of March 1, 2020, did not have a residence
                  permit or whose residency had expired, to depart Kuwait
                  between April 1 and April 30, 2020 without paying a fine. The
                  Ministry of Interior has announced that Article 22 (dependent)
                  and Article 24 (self-employed) visa holders can renew their
                  resident permits online. Residents may now also extend their
                  temporary residence visa (Article 14) online for three months
                  for a KD 3 fee. The Embassy is engaging with the Kuwaiti
                  government on how Ministerial Decision 288 applies to tourist
                  visa holders. A further Ministerial Decree 355/2020 granted a
                  temporary visa extension through May 31, 2020 for individuals
                  on all types of entry visas. In addition, all tourist visas
                  and residencies are now extended through August 31, 2020. All
                  commercial flights to and from Kuwait are suspended until
                  further notice.
