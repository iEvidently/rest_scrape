                  British Airways and Ryanair have suspended flights to and from
                  the United Kingdom. Travelers in the UK whose UK visa is due
                  to expire or has expired between January 24 to July 31, 2020
                  (previously May 31) and are unable to leave the UK because of
                  travel restrictions or self-isolation, will be granted an
                  extension of stay to July 31, 2020 (previously May 31) by
                  contacting the Home Office Coronavirus Immigration Team. For
                  someone who has already obtained a visa extension to May 31
                  2020 under this scheme, the visa will be extended
                  automatically to July 31, 2020. Visa Application Centers and
                  locations to provide biometrics (for UK visa purposes) in many
                  countries are either temporarily closed or offering limited
                  services. Authorities plan to begin easing restrictions on May
                  13, 2020.

                  Travelers arriving in Shanghai from any location will be
                  subject to a nucleic acid test upon arrival likely to be
                  conducted at government-designated facilities, which may cause
                  considerable delay in onward travel; until results are
                  available arrivals not subject to mandatory quarantine must
                  nevertheless self-quarantine until notified. Additional

                  provinces. All inbound international flights must land at
                  Beijing Capital Airport (PEK), where passengers will undergo
                  further health assessments and review their travel history

                  All scheduled international commercial passenger services will

                  citizens) in India, with the following exception. From May 07,
                  2020, the Indian government has been evacuating stranded
                  Indian citizens in a phased manner from several countries on
                  special flights. On May 22, 2020, the Government of India
                  announced that the following categories of Overseas Citizens
                  of India (OCI) cardholders may travel to India on special
                  evacuation flights. 1. Minor children who are born to Indian
                  nationals abroad and who hold valid OCI cards; 2. OCI
                  cardholders who wish to come to India on account of family
                  emergencies; 3. University students who are OCI cardholders
                  (not minors) and whose parents are Indian citizens living in
                  India; and 4. Couples where one spouse is an OCI cardholder
                  and the other is an Indian national and who permanently reside
                  in India. Anyone who qualifies for an evacuation flight must
                  register with the Indian consular post in their jurisdiction
                  and only travel to India on the designated flight. While there
                  is no specific announcement regarding departure of flights
                  from India, they are virtually at a standstill.

                  Effective April 13, 2020, visa waiver/visa-free privileges of
                  nationals of 90 countries will be suspended; these include
                  Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, many European
                  countries, and Canada. However, the effective date of
                  suspension can vary by country because some visa exemption
                  treaties require a notice period to elapse before a suspension
                  can take effect. Visitors who have been in the Hubei Province
                  China (PRC) in the past 14 days are not allowed to transit or
                  enter South Korea. Nationals of China (PRC) with a passport
                  issued in the Hubei Province are not allowed to enter South
                  Korea. Korean visas issued by the Wuhan Consulate in the Hubei
                  Province are invalidated. A visa is required to transit
                  through South Korea for nationals of China (PRC). Nationals of
                  Japan who do not hold a Korean visa issued on or after March
                  9, 2020 will not be allowed entry. Foreign travelers not
                  entering Korea are allowed to transfer without a visa unless:
                  they departed from China, they have been to Hubei in the last
                  14 days, or their passports or visa were issued in Hubei.

                  Government offices and ministries closed until May 31, 2020,

                  to May 30, 2020. Per the US State Department, Kuwait
                  Ministerial Decision 288 dated March 26, 2020 gives the option
                  to foreign nationals, including US citizens, who, as of March
                  1, 2020, did not have a residence permit or whose residency
                  had expired, to depart Kuwait between April 1 and April 30,
                  2020 without paying a fine. The Ministry of Interior has
                  announced that Article 22 (dependent) and Article 24
                  (self-employed) visa holders can renew their resident permits
                  online. Residents may now also extend their temporary
                  residence visa (Article 14) online for three months for a KD 3
                  fee. The Embassy is engaging with the Kuwaiti government on
                  how Ministerial Decision 288 applies to tourist visa holders.
                  A further Ministerial Decree 355/2020 grants a temporary visa
                  extension through May 31, 2020 for individuals on all type of
                  entry visas.
