                  Scotland and Wales have so far not confirmed that they will be
                  amending their regulations, though Northern Ireland currently
                  plans to maintain quarantine for all international arrivals
                  other than those from Ireland. All international arrivals to
                  the UK must provide contact details, as well as their travel
                  history over the previous 14 days. For other international
                  arrivals, they are required to self-isolate for 14 days upon
                  arrival. The measures apply to arrival by air, rail, and
                  ferry. Persons arriving from Ireland, the Channel Islands, and
                  the Isle of Man are exempt from the restrictions.

                  Travelers from EU and Schengen countries can travel in and out
                  of The Netherlands. Dutch advice and rules to combat the
                  spread of COVID-19 must be followed. Travelers from high-risk
                  areas are strongly urged to go into quarantine for 14 days
                  (e.g. Sweden and the United Kingdom). All passengers
                  travelling to the Netherlands from an airport in a high risk
                  area must complete a health declaration form. The form
                  contains questions related to the presence of symptoms which
                  could be related to the COVID-19 virus. Before boarding a
                  plane the crew checks the completed health declaration form.
                  In case you have one of the symptoms as listed in the health
                  declaration form, you will not be accepted on the flight to
                  the Netherlands. This is also applicable for transit
                  passengers. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA)
                  maintains a list of airports in areas with a high risk of
                  contamination. Please verify with your airport of destination
                  if additional requirements apply there. You can find measures
                  at Schiphol (the largest Dutch airport) here:
                  https://www.schiphol.nl/en/page/coronavirus/ Transit travelers
                  are allowed. Returning residents from countries with elevated
                  disease activity must self-isolate for 14 days.

                  distancing guidelines and have not been diagnosed with
                  COVID-19 within the past 14 days. Officials publish a list of

                  where cases of COVID-19 do not exceed 25 per 100,000 for a
                  continuous period of 14 days. Travelers from these countries
                  are permitted to travel to Lithuania. The current List of

                  non-European countries from July 1, 2020: Algeria, Australia,

                  Rwanda, Serbia, South Korea, Thailand, Tunisia, Uruguay, and

                  recommendation is not binding for the member states. This

                  Irish embassies/ consulates around the world have temporarily
                  suspended in-person visa services but for emergency visas
                  (e.g., healthcare professionals) and for priority cases for
                  family members of citizens, legal residents, and EU citizens
                  in Ireland. The EU Council recommended lifting of the travel
                  ban for 15 non-European countries from July 1, 2020: Algeria,
                  Australia, Canada, Georgia, Japan, Montenegro, Morocco, New
                  Zealand, Rwanda, Serbia, South Korea, Thailand, Tunisia,
                  Uruguay, and China, if they open their borders for EU
                  travelers. The recommendation is not binding for the member
                  states. This isn’t decided or published from the Irish
                  government yet.

                  The borders with Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, Switzerland,
                  and Spain are reopened. Third-country travelers (non-EU) need
                  to have a certificate and supporting documents mentioning
                  their reasons for the trip. A nationwide state of emergency is
                  in effect until July 10, 2020. Effective June 22, 2020, trips
                  to French overseas departments are allowed. Travel to Mayotte,
                  Guyane, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, and Wallis &amp;
                  Futuna remains restricted and is authorized only on special
                  occasions. The EU Council recommended lifting of the travel
                  ban for 15 non-European countries from July 1, 2020: Algeria,
                  Australia, Canada, Georgia, Japan, Montenegro, Morocco, New
                  Zealand, Rwanda, Serbia, South Korea, Thailand, Tunisia,
                  Uruguay, and China, if they open their borders for EU
                  -Ttravelers. The recommendation is not binding for the member
                  states. This isn’t decided or published from the French
                  government yet.

                  People from the age of 12 who enter by train/bus/coach are
                  obliged to wear a mask. The EU Council recommended lifting of
                  the travel ban for 15 non-European countries from July 1,
                  2020: Algeria, Australia, Canada, Georgia, Japan, Montenegro,
                  Morocco, New Zealand, Rwanda, Serbia, South Korea, Thailand,
                  Tunisia, Uruguay, and China, if they open their borders for EU
                  -Ttravelers. The recommendation is not binding for the member
                  states. This isn’t decided or published from the Belgium
                  government yet. Most non-essential businesses are open.
                  Passengers on public transport are required to wear protective
                  masks.

                  are categorized. Effective June 30, 2020, passengers arriving
                  from countries from Category A face no restrictions; while
                  passengers from countries from Category B will continue to
                  need a negative COVID-19 test taken no longer than 72 hours
                  before departure. Travelers from countries that are not
                  included in the two above categories remain banned from entry.

                  Airports have reopened June 9, 2020. Flights are restored with
                  two categories of countries: Category A: Australia, Austria,

                  Luxembourg, Monaco, Netherlands, Romania, San Marino, Serbia,

                  from July 1, 2020, when arrivals from countries with high
                  COVID-19 activity will be required to undergo medical
                  screening and quarantine. The EU Council recommended lifting

                  2020: Algeria, Australia, Canada, Georgia, Japan, Montenegro,
                  Morocco, New Zealand, Rwanda, Serbia, South Korea, Thailand,
                  Tunisia, Uruguay, and China, if they open their borders for EU
                  travelers. The recommendation is not binding for the member
                  states. This isn’t decided or published from the Cypriot
                  government yet.

                  Traveling from countries with medium and high risk will be
                  allowed only to exempted categories and negative PCR test will
                  have to be submitted on entry. A list of such countries based
                  on the epidemiologic situation will be published and updated
                  on a weekly basis. EU citizens entering for the purpose of
                  economic activity for a period exceeding 72 hours have to
                  submit a medical certificate. Third-country citizens have to
                  submit a medical certificate supplemented by a negative test.
                  The EU Council recommended lifting of the travel ban for 15
                  non-European countries from July 1, 2020: Algeria, Australia,
                  Canada, Georgia, Japan, Montenegro, Morocco, New Zealand,
                  Rwanda, Serbia, South Korea, Thailand, Tunisia, Uruguay, and
                  China, if they open their borders for EU -Ttravelers. The
                  recommendation is not binding for the member states. This
                  isn’t decided or published from the Czech government yet.

                  the General Directorate of Residency and Foreign Affairs and
                  the airline. Residents who hold Dubai-issued visas are
                  permitted to return to the emirate on any airline on the
                  condition that they obtain prior approval from the General
                  Directorate of Residency and Foreign Affairs and the airline.

                  prohibition on entry by Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
                  nationals is in place. As of June 23, 2020, there are no
                  restrictions on overseas destinations to which citizens and
                  residents of Dubai can travel. Entry into Abu Dhabi requires a

                  Foreign nationals who are not residents of Croatia will need
                  to provide proof of an accommodation booking. Croatian
                  Airports have reopened for international flights. Foreign
                  nationals are allowed to use their existing Croatian permanent
                  resident permits to live and work in Croatia with no
                  interruptions, even if the permits have expired. Passports and
                  national ID cards issued to nationals of Croatia are
                  considered valid even if expired on May 11, 2020 or later.
                  Zagreb’s Franjo Tudjman Airport (ZAG) remains the only airport
                  open for international flights. The EU Council recommended
                  lifting of the travel ban for 15 non-European countries from
                  July 1, 2020: Algeria, Australia, Canada, Georgia, Japan,
                  Montenegro, Morocco, New Zealand, Rwanda, Serbia, South Korea,
                  Thailand, Tunisia, Uruguay, and China, if they open their
                  borders for EU travelers. The recommendation is not binding
                  for the member states. This isn’t decided or published from
                  the Croatian government yet.

                  International version. After April 22, 2020, passengers should
                  make daily report 14 days before the date of boarding. Russia
                  has been added to this list since April 15, 2020. All
                  international flights to Beijing are currently being
                  redirected to 12 other cities. Once those with symptoms or
                  identified as or suspicious of carrying the virus have been
                  identified, other passengers will then be able to travel to
                  Beijing, although significant delay can be expected. Once
                  those identified passengers complete the 14-day mandatory
                  quarantine in these other cities and get a negative test
                  result, if they travel to Beijing on the same or following
                  day, they will not be subject to further quarantine in
                  Beijing. Otherwise, another 14-day mandatory quarantine will
                  be required upon arrival in Beijing. Almost all arriving
                  travelers from overseas will be subject to 14-day quarantine
                  requirement with exceptions in certain regions where longer
                  quarantine period is required. All inbound travelers to
                  Shenzhen shall be subject to 14-day mandatory quarantine at
                  government designated facilities. All inbound travelers
                  arriving in Shanghai from any country will be subject to
                  14-day mandatory quarantine and nucleic acid test . Additional
                  domestic rules may apply to multi-city travel (e.g., overseas
                  arrival in Shanghai then onward transit to Beijing). "Fast
                  track" entry is allowed for business travelers from South
                  Korea to 10 Chinese locations, including Shanghai and
                  Liaoning, Shandong, Jiangsu, and Anhui provinces, where such
                  travelers will be subject to one- or two-days quarantine
                  instead of a normal 14-day quarantine. Approved travelers from
                  South Korea will have to undergo testing in South Korea within
                  72 hours of travel and undergo testing again during a one or
                  two-day quarantine in China (PRC). Travelers must receive a
                  negative COVID-19 test result within seven days of their
                  departure from Beijing for essential trips.

                  any employees arriving from overseas and high-risk areas in
                  China (PRC). Effective, June 16, 2020, controls and transport

                  Fengtai, Chaoyang, Daxing, and Mentougou are placed under “war

                  Azerbaijan has temporarily suspended the issuance of e-visas.
                  Foreign nationals whose visas are due to expire by April 30,

                  60-day visa extension. Inter-regional travel has resumed.
                  International passenger traffic remains suspended through July
                  1, 2020. The restrictions do not apply to emergency and cargo
                  flights. Lockdown is in effect in Baku, Sumgayit, Lankaran,
                  Yevlakh, Jalilabad, Absheron, Ganja and Masalli until July 5,
                  2020. Authorities have extended the existing quarantine regime
                  until at least August 1, 2020. Certain businesses have
                  reopened.

                  All scheduled international commercial passenger services will
                  remain closed until July 15, 2020. Until then, no
                  international aircraft will be allowed to disembark passengers
                  (including citizens) in India, with the following exception.
                  From May 7, 2020, the Indian government has been evacuating
                  stranded Indian citizens in a phased manner from several
                  countries on special flights. On May 22, 2020, the Government
                  of India announced that the following categories of Overseas
                  Citizens of India (OCI) cardholders may travel to India on
                  special evacuation flights. (1) Minor children who are born to
                  Indian nationals abroad and who hold valid OCI cards; (2) OCI
                  cardholders who wish to come to India on account of family
                  emergencies; (3) University students who are OCI cardholders
                  (not minors) and whose parents are Indian citizens living in
                  India; and (4) Couples where one spouse is an OCI cardholder
                  and the other is an Indian national and who permanently reside
                  in India. The Indian government is permitting entry of foreign
                  nationals with a fresh or renewed business visa as of June 15,
                  2020. Authorized travelers include those with the managerial
                  and technical expertise required by a foreign entity located
                  in India or an Indian entity providing a letter of invitation,
                  others include Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) cardholders and
                  foreign nationals related to OCI cardholders or Indian
                  citizens. Family members of those in India with diplomatic,
                  official, or UN/international organizations visas are also
                  permitted to enter India. Such travelers must approach Indian
                  consulates for fresh visas regardless of previous visa status
                  and may enter the country via non-scheduled flights due to an
                  ongoing ban on commercial international passenger flights
                  through June 30, 2020. Anyone who qualifies for an evacuation
                  flight must register with the Indian consular post in their
                  jurisdiction and only travel to India on the designated
                  flight. While there is no specific announcement regarding
                  departure of flights from India, they are virtually at a
                  standstill. Indian officials are maintaining a ban on
                  travelers from Afghanistan, the EU, the European Free Trade
                  Association, Malaysia, Philippines, Turkey, and the United
                  Kingdom.

                  others, have obtained permission from the Indian government

                  Indian Government and airlines by clearing flights to leave
                  India. All visa services (excluding in-country registration,
                  visa extension, and other in-country services) remain
                  suspended until further notice. Visas of all foreign nationals

                  and May 31, 2020 (both dates inclusive).

                  Nationals and residents returning to Taiwan are subject to
                  14-day home quarantine. Effective April 21, 2020, inbound
                  travelers who have visited Southeast Asia in the last 14 days
                  (starting 00:00 Taipei Standard Time on April 7, 2020) should

                  traveling from medium-risk destinations must quarantine for
                  seven days at government-designated facilities. Travelers will
                  also have to pay for another COVID-19 test before their

                  travelers should stay at a quarantine hotel after entering
                  Taiwan if they live with people who are 65 years old or older,
                  children six years old or under, persons with chronic diseases
                  (such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes or lung diseases),

                  separate bathroom).The business traveler shall prepare an
                  English certificate of a negative COVID-19 RT-PCR test result
                  issued within three days prior to boarding the flight to
                  Taiwan for authority inspection. Effective 4 July, Alien
                  Resident Card holders are not required to provide a COVID-19
                  negative report when returning to Taiwan. In applicable cases,
                  certificate of negative COVID-19 RT-PCT test taken within 3
                  days prior to flight to Taiwan has now been relaxed to 3
                  working days.

                  By Presidential Proclamation, effective April 23, 2020,
                  issuance of immigrant visas (for US permanent residency) to
                  individuals outside the United States paused for 60 days. The
                  US State Department has raised its travel alert for US
                  citizens to Level 4 (Do Not Travel), the highest advisory
                  level. All US embassies and consulates have temporarily
                  suspended routine visa services and will cancel all routine
                  immigrant and nonimmigrant visa appointments as of March 20,
                  2020. As resources allow, embassies and consulates will
                  continue to provide emergency and mission critical visa
                  services. Travelers who have visited China (PRC), Iran,
                  Ireland, the United Kingdom, or the Schengen countries
                  (Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia,

                  Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia,
                  Spain, Sweden and Switzerland) in the past 14 days must arrive
                  at one of the following airports: Atlanta (ATL), Boston (BOS),
                  Chicago (ORD), Dallas, (DFW), Detroit (DTW), Honolulu (HNL),
                  Los Angeles (LAX), Miami (MIA), New York (JFK or EWR), San

                  major airlines have cancelled or reduced flights to China,

                  International air, road, and rail travel has resumed with
                  certain limitations. Romanian authorities have extended the
                  COVID-19-related state of alert until July 17, 2020. The EU
                  Council recommended lifting of the travel ban for 15
                  non-European countries from July 1, 2020: Algeria, Australia,
                  Canada, Georgia, Japan, Montenegro, Morocco, New Zealand,
                  Rwanda, Serbia, South Korea, Thailand, Tunisia, Uruguay, and
                  China, if they open their borders for EU travelers. The
                  recommendation is not binding for the member states. This
                  isn’t decided or published from the Romania government yet.

                  Polish authorities will ease additional restrictions from June
                  6, 2020. International passenger flights to EU destinations
                  have resumed as of June 16, 2020. Work permits and statements
                  about entrusting work to foreigner (Special Permissions),
                  national visas and residence cards that expire during epidemic
                  will be automatically prolonged until 30 days after end of
                  epidemic state. Foreigners other than Polish national visa
                  holders and Polish residence permit holders will be allowed to
                  continue their stay in Poland past expiry of their right of
                  stay. This is applicable to: (1) Holders of Schengen visas;
                  (2) Holders of Residence Permits or long term visas issued by
                  another Schengen country; and (3) Foreigners staying in Poland
                  based on visa free movement. These foreigners will have their
                  right to stay in Poland extended until 30 days after
                  cancellation of the epidemic state, provided that they were
                  already staying in Poland on March 14, 2020. Eligible seasonal
                  workers are exempt from work permit requirement until 30 days
                  after end of epidemic state, provided that they already held a
                  proper work authorization document after March 13, 2020. The
                  EU Council recommended lifting of the travel ban for 15
                  non-European countries from July 1, 2020: Algeria, Australia,
                  Canada, Georgia, Japan, Montenegro, Morocco, New Zealand,
                  Rwanda, Serbia, South Korea, Thailand, Tunisia, Uruguay, and
                  China, if they open their borders for EU travelers. The
                  recommendation is not binding for the member states. This
                  isn’t decided or published from the Bulgarian government yet.

                  Nationals and residents of Maldives will be subject to 14-day
                  quarantine upon arrival. All passengers traveling for a
                  purpose other than tourism will be quarantined for 14 days at
                  a government-designated location. A completed "Health
                  Declaration Card" and an "Immigration Arrival Card" must be
                  presented upon arrival. Maldivian citizens arriving from the
                  United States will be quarantined at a designated facility for
                  14 days. Officials have said mandatory quarantine and testing
                  will not be necessary for asymptomatic travelers from July 15,
                  2020. However, regulations may vary based on a passenger’s
                  nationality and travel history, and authorities can rescind,
                  delay, or alter planned resumptions of international travel at
                  short notice.

                  All Macao residents who have been in Schengen Area, the United

                  South Korea, Japan, Iran, and New Zealand in the past 14 days
                  are subject to quarantine for 14 days. Residents and travelers
                  who visited Hong Kong, Taiwan, and other countries are allowed
                  to self-isolate at home. As of 14 June, 2020, Macau and Zhuhai
                  have eased quarantine requirements for some travel. Officials
                  are permitting Macau citizens that live in Zhuhai with
                  residency permits to cross the border without quarantine
                  requirements, after applying for an exemption. Macau teachers
                  and students residing in Zhuhai do not have to apply for the
                  exemption. Travelers must receive approval from health
                  authorities via an online application and undergo a nucleic
                  acid test for COVID-19 within 48 hours of traveling to Zhuhai.
                  People receiving approval can travel across the border an
                  unlimited number of times within seven days but cannot leave
                  Guangdong. Effective June 23, 2020, nonresident workers in
                  Zhuhai entering the territory must obtain confirmation of
                  their residence from Zhuhai officials, show a green Macau
                  health code, and provide evidence of a negative COVID-19
                  nucleic acid test within seven days of entering the territory.
                  Officials will also allow some workers to enter Macau if their
                  COVID-19 test was within the past 24 hours.. Macau is
                  requiring travelers who have visited Beijing within 14 days of
                  arrival to quarantine at designated locations for two weeks as
                  of June 17, 2020.

                  Effective March 11, 2020, non-Kuwaiti citizens are barred from
                  entering Kuwait through the airport (except non-Kuwaiti
                  immediate family members of Kuwaiti citizens traveling
                  together). Effective March 14, 2020, the Kuwait International
                  Airport has been closed until further notice to all inbound
                  commercial flights except for arriving Kuwaiti citizens and
                  their immediate relatives traveling with them; Since April 11,
                  Kuwait International Airport has re-opened only to allow
                  airlines to operate a limited number of outbound flights.
                  Kuwait has closed its airport and land border with Iraq.

                  Government offices and ministries closed until May 31, 2020.
                  Effective June 21, 2020 until further notice, the 24-hour
                  curfew will be replaced by a nightly 19:00-05:00 curfew.
                  24-hour curfews on Meedan Hawally, Khaitan, Al-Negra, and
                  unspecified blocks of Khaitan will be lifted from 05:00 June
                  21, 2020. A 24-hour curfew remains in force in Farwaniya,
                  Jaleeb Al-Shukoukh, and Maboula until further notice. Per the
                  US State Department, Kuwait Ministerial Decision 288 dated
                  March 26, 2020 gives the option to foreign nationals,
                  including US citizens, who, as of March 1, 2020, did not have
                  a residence permit or whose residency had expired, to depart
                  Kuwait between April 1 and April 30, 2020 without paying a
                  fine. The Ministry of Interior has announced that Article 22
                  (dependent) and Article 24 (self-employed) visa holders can
                  renew their resident permits online. Residents may now also
                  extend their temporary residence visa (Article 14) online for
                  three months for a KD 3 fee. The Embassy is engaging with the
                  Kuwaiti government on how Ministerial Decision 288 applies to
                  tourist visa holders. A further Ministerial Decree 355/2020
                  granted a temporary visa extension through May 31, 2020 for
                  individuals on all types of entry visas. In addition, all
                  tourist visas and residencies are now extended through August
                  31, 2020. All commercial flights to and from Kuwait are
                  suspended until further notice. Commercial flights from Kuwait
                  International Airport (KWI) will be resumed from August 1,
                  2020.

                  Transit through Bahrain International Airport is permitted to
                  limited travels. Bahrain's flag carrier Gulf Air is to operate
                  13 of its 49 destinations on reduced service, including Abu
                  Dhabi, Dubai, London, Paris, Frankfurt, and Mumbai. Flights to
                  and from Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Lebanon, Kuwait, Jordan, and
                  Morocco are suspended until further notice. Visa on arrival
                  suspended, with limited exception. Electronic visa services
                  and other types of visas will still be open to the public, and
                  visas issued by authorities before the COVID-19-associated
                  restrictions were put in place will still be valid. Border
                  crossing on the causeway has been temporarily suspended.
