                  COVID-19 test no older than 72 hours. Without a test, they
                  will need to go to a state-provided quarantine facility, where
                  they will have the chance to take a test, leave the facility,
                  and self-isolate for 14 days assuming the test is negative. If
                  the test is positive, they will be required to spend 14-day in
                  quarantine. The facilities are usually hotels located
                  throughout the country. Foreigners who do not have a residency

                  COVID-19 test no older than 72 hours. Without a test, they
                  will need to go to a state-provided quarantine facility, where
                  they will have the chance to take a test, leave the facility,
                  and self-isolate for 14 days assuming the test is negative. If
                  the test is positive, they will be required to spend 14-day in
                  quarantine. The facilities are usually hotels located
                  throughout the country. Foreigners who do not have a residency
                  permit remain barred from entry unless simply transiting
                  through the country. If only transiting, they will have to
                  leave the country no later than five hours after entry, and
                  are not allowed to leave areas adjoining the highways.
                  Effective June 26, 2020, the government will lift the
                  requirement that citizens entering the country either produce
                  proof of having tested negative for COVID-19 or undergo a
                  14-day quarantine.

                  Effective April 17, 2020, Egyptian authorities resumed the
                  closure of the Gazan-Egyptian Rafah border crossing.
                  Egyptian's Rafah border crossing with the Gaza Strip reopened
                  from August 11 - 13, 2020, to permit the repatriation of
                  travelers on both sides of the border who had been stranded
                  due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A state of emergency has been
                  extended in the West Bank through at least October 4, 2020. A
                  lockdown will be imposed on all West Bank towns and
                  governorates through at least July 26, 2020. Authorities in
                  the Gaza Strip have extended their existing 24-hour curfew
                  until further notice.

                  All flights to and from Morocco are suspended indefinitely.
                  However, some airlines continue to operate limited
                  repatriation and charter flights. ​ Effective March 16, 2020,
                  sea travel to Spain, Gibraltar, and France is suspended and
                  the border with the Spanish autonomous cities of Ceuta and
                  Melilla on the north coast of Africa is closed. Effective July
                  26, 2020, authorities in Morocco have implemented a travel ban
                  for the cities of Berrechid, Casablanca, Fez, Marrakesh,
                  Meknes, Settat, Tangier, and Tetouan due to a recent surge in
                  COVID-19 cases. Individuals are prohibited from entering or
                  exiting the cities, except for essential travel, such as
                  seeking medical care or transporting goods. As of September 7,
                  2020, international passenger flights remain suspended until
                  further notice, however, some airlines continue to operate
                  limited repatriation and charter flights. Emergency and cargo
                  flights can still operate normally. Sea travel to Spain,
                  Gibraltar, and France remain suspended. The border with the
                  Spanish autonomous cities of Ceuta and Melilla, located on the
                  north coast of Africa, is closed until further notice.
                  Authorities in Morocco have announced plans to reopen the
                  country's borders to authorized business visitors beginning
                  September 10, 2020. The term "authorized business visitor" is
                  defined as a traveler who has received an invitation from a
                  Moroccan company to travel to the country and who has
                  confirmed hotel reservations. The invitation from a Moroccan
                  company must include the traveler's full name along with his
                  or her passport number, as well the purpose of the visit and
                  how long the visitor will be staying in the country.​
                  International passenger flights remain suspended until further
                  notice, however, some airlines continue to operate limited

                  A state of emergency has been declared. Libya's UN-recognized
                  government in Tripoli imposed a four-day complete lockdown as
                  of August 26, 2020. Following the four-day lockdown,
                  authorities will continue to impose a nightly 2021:00-06:00
                  curfew, with a 24-hour curfew in effect on Fridays and
                  Saturdays. The GNA has also imposed a complete curfew in areas
                  captured from the self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA) in
                  southern Libya. Libya's Tripoli-based internationally
                  recognized Government of National Accord (GNA) has announced
                  plans to resume flights at Mitiga International Airport (MJI)
                  beginning August 9, 2020.

                  24-hours before entering the island. Upon arrival, travelers
                  will undergo health checks, including COVID-19 Rapid Test. If
                  the results are negative, the traveler may move freely within
                  the island. Should a test result come back positive, the
                  traveler will need to self-quarantine for 14-days in a
                  government facility or certified hotel. Upon entry, nationals
                  of Dominica will be placed in a 14-day mandatory quarantine.

                  As of July 1, 2020, all arriving passengers will be tested for
                  COVID-19 and be placed under mandatory 24-hour
                  self-quarantine. Arrivals with a negative antibody test (dated
                  within the last five days) and negative COVID-19 test taken on
                  arrival will be exempt from further quarantine. Regardless of
                  approved documentation, travelers who test positive for
                  COVID-19 on arrival will be subject to 14 days of
                  self-quarantine. Persons arriving from the CARICOM bubble will
                  not be tested for COVID-19 provided they have been in the
                  CARICOM bubble for at least 14 days.

                  Authorities in French Guiana have amended the restrictions
                  implemented in the territory to stem the spread of coronavirus
                  disease (COVID-19). As of September 28, 2020, a nightly

                  except for Iracoubo, Ouanary, Regina, Saint-Elie, and Saul
                  townships, where there is no curfew. Residents may not leave
                  their homes during curfew hours, except for emergencies.

                  ​Heightened screening measures are imposed on commercial and
                  freight transport. All international travelers must, on
                  arrival in the country, present a negative COVID-19 polymerase
                  chain reaction (PRC) test, and will be subject to various
                  regulations:​ (i) if the test was taken less than 72 hours
                  before arrival in the country, travelers will not be subject
                  to another test on arrival, but must quarantine for 14 days at
                  their accommodation; (ii) if the test was taken more than 72
                  hours but less than 10 days prior to arrival, travelers must
                  take a second test on arrival and quarantine for 14 days at
                  their accommodation; (iii) in the absence of a test within 10
                  days prior to arrival, travelers will be transferred to a
                  hotel and tested within 48 hours, if the result is negative,
                  travelers may move to their accommodation to complete their
                  14-day quarantine, if the result is positive, travelers will
                  be moved from the hotel to a government COVID-19 management
                  site; (iv) arriving symptomatic travelers will be quarantined
                  at a government facility, and will only be released following
                  two negative tests. Once released, they must complete a 14-day
                  quarantine at their accommodation.

                  Entry requirements into Tunisia vary depending on the
                  prevalence of COVID-19 in a traveler's country of origin.
                  Authorities have classified countries as green, orange, or
                  red. Arrivals from green countries are not required to take a
                  test before departing to Tunisia or self-isolate upon arrival.
                  Arrivals from orange countries are required to take a COVID-19
                  test 72 hours before departure, quarantine for at least 14
                  days upon arrival, and sign a declaration to abide by these
                  measures. Tunisians are requested to self-isolate for 14 days
                  at home. Travelers from red countries are not permitted entry
                  unless they are Tunisian nationals or residents. Authorities
                  will place such persons in mandatory quarantine for seven
                  days. Effective August 26, 2020, arriving passengers must have
                  a medical certificate with negative Coronavirus PCR test
                  result issued at most 120 hours before arrival. A completed
                  Health Declaration form must be presented before boarding and
                  to the Immigration upon arrival. All arriving passengers are
                  subject to quarantine of 14 days.

                  at least July 29, 2020. Officials have lifted partial lockdown

                  Effective May 30, 2020, Pakistan authorities are permitting

                  passenger flights carrying Pakistani citizens to enter the
                  country from June 20, 2020, are permitted. Inbound foreign
                  nationals remain banned until at least June 30, 2020.
                  International passenger flight operations have resumed at all
                  international airports in the country as at August 12, 2020.
                  Domestic flights between airports serving Karachi (KHI),
                  Lahore (LHE), Islamabad (ISB), Peshawar (PEW), Quetta (UET)

                  operations at all international airports in the country as of
                  September 15, 2020. However, flights are severely restricted
                  in number and routes due to low demand and travel restrictions
                  imposed by foreign countries on Pakistani citizens and air
                  carriers.

                  Spain or USA in the past 14 days will be quarantined for 14
                  days. Foreign business travelers who enter the country are
                  exempt from the two-week self-isolation requirement, though
                  they must still isolate at designated facilities for several
                  days upon arrival in Cambodia while waiting for COVID-19 test
                  results. These visitors may still have to quarantine for 14
                  days if any passenger on their Cambodia-bound flight tests
                  positive for COVID-19. Business travelers must adhere to other
                  protocols, including obtaining sponsorship from a local

                  Travelers to England need to self-isolate if they visited or
                  made a transit stop in a country or territory that is not on
                  the travel corridors list in the 14 days before arriving in
                  England. Authorities in England will lift a mandatory
                  quarantine requirement for arrivals from e.g. Australia,
                  Germany, Italy, and New Zealand. Authorities in Northern
                  Ireland, Scotland, and Wales have their own lists with safe
                  countries, setting their own quarantine requirements. Scotland
                  and Wales have so far not confirmed that they will be amending
                  their regulations, though Northern Ireland currently plans to
                  maintain quarantine for all international arrivals other than
                  those from Ireland. All international arrivals to the UK must
                  provide contact details, as well as their travel history over
                  the previous 14 days. All international arrivals to the UK
                  must provide contact details, as well as their travel history
                  over the previous 14 days. Health officials may perform spot
                  checks to ensure compliance. Persons without suitable
                  accommodation will be required to stay in facilities arranged
                  by the government at their own expense. The measures apply to
                  arrival by air, rail, and ferry.

                  countries; passengers from Portuguese-speaking countries; and
                  passengers from the United States. Passengers arriving at
                  Lisbon, Oporto, Faro, and Beja airports will be required to
                  carry out a temperature scan by infrared and, if detected with
                  fever, they will be subject to a second temperature scan. If
                  the situation assessment justifies it, they will be subject to
                  a test for COVID-19 and will be allowed to leave the airport
                  after providing their contact details. They will be required
                  to remain confined at their destination until they receive the
                  negative result of the PCR test.​ Travelers flying to the
                  Madeira archipelago need a negative COVID-19 test taken within
                  72 hours prior to departure or they can perform it upon
                  arrival. Travelers flying to the Azores archipelago can choose
                  one of the following options: (i) submit proof of COVID-19
                  testing up to 72 hours prior to flight departure; (ii) perform
                  test on arrival and stay in prophylactic isolation until the
                  result is obtained; (iii) perform voluntary quarantine for a
                  period of 14 days in a hotel indicated for the purpose; (iv)
                  return to the destination of origin or travel to any
                  destination outside the region, fulfilling, until the time of
                  the flight, prophylactic isolation in a hotel indicated for
                  this purpose.

                  As part of ongoing efforts to limit the spread of COVID-19,
                  authorities in Portugal will extend the nationwide state of
                  contingency until at least October 15, 2020. The European
                  Council has issued a revised list of countries for which
                  Schengen member states should relax entry restrictions as of
                  September 1, 2020. The list includes Canada, Georgia, Japan,
                  New Zealand, Rwanda, South Korea, Thailand, Tunisia, Uruguay,
                  and China (PRC) (provided China implements a reciprocal travel
                  arrangement). The European Council's recommendation is
                  advisory only, individual member states retain the authority
                  to unilaterally deny travel from countries on the approved
                  list or to permit travel with countries not on the approved
                  list.

                  Travelers from countries classified as "orange" or "red" are
                  recommended to quarantine for 10 days. All passengers
                  traveling to the Netherlands from an airport in a high risk
                  area must complete a health declaration form. The form
                  contains questions related to the presence of symptoms which
                  could be related to the COVID-19 virus. Before boarding a
                  plane the crew checks the completed health declaration form.
                  In case you have one of the symptoms as listed in the health
                  declaration form, you will not be accepted on the flight to
                  the Netherlands. This is also applicable for transit
                  passengers. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA)
                  maintains a list of airports in areas with a high risk of
                  contamination. Please verify with your airport of destination
                  if additional requirements apply there. You can find measures
                  at Schiphol (the largest Dutch airport) here:
                  https://www.schiphol.nl/en/page/coronavirus/ Transit travelers
                  are allowed. All passengers over 13 years of age must fill out
                  a COVID-19 screening form before their flight when traveling
                  to or from Dutch airports.

                  The European Council has issued a revised list of countries
                  for which Schengen member states should relax entry
                  restrictions as of August 1, 2020. The European Council's
                  recommendation is advisory only, individual member states
                  retain the authority to unilaterally deny travel from
                  countries on the approved list or to permit travel with
                  countries not on the approved list. Allows entry for citizens
                  from countries, as long as a country or an area is not defined
                  as "high-risk" by the Robert Koch Institute. The entry rule is
                  based on the country from which the traveler is coming from,
                  and not on nationality. The entry rule is applicable for
                  people who have been in a risk area at any time within the
                  last 14 days prior to entry. Allows entry for third country
                  citizens from Australia, Canada, Georgia, New Zealand,
                  Thailand, Tunisia and Uruguay. For all persons that reside in
                  a third country, not included in the above list, the current
                  restrictions on travel continue to apply. These persons may
                  enter Germany only if there is an urgent need for travel.

                  In cases of suspected infection in cross-border traffic to
                  Germany, the Federal Police will immediately contact the local
                  health authorities for medical examinations, screening and/or
                  quarantine measures. Travelers entering from a country
                  classified as a risk area according to the Robert Koch
                  Institute (areas with an increased 7-day incidence of more
                  than 50 cases per 100,000 inhabitants). Travelers entering
                  Germany, who have been in a risk area at any time within the
                  14 days prior their entry, may have an obligation to
                  self-isolate or to present a negative COVID-19 test result in
                  accordance with the respective quarantine regulations of the
                  responsible federal state. Exceptions are possible, if
                  passengers have a medical certificate confirming that there is
                  no evidence of a COVID-19 infection. The certificate needs to
                  be from a member state of the EU or another state published by
                  the Robert Koch Institute and shall not be older than 48 hours
                  upon arrival. The quarantine requirement also applies to
                  travelers with an important reason for travel (with the
                  exception of transit passengers).

                  The European Council has issued a revised list of countries
                  for which Schengen member states should relax entry
                  restrictions as of August 1, 2020. The European Council's
                  recommendation is advisory only, individual member states
                  retain the authority to unilaterally deny travel from
                  countries on the approved list or to permit travel with
                  countries not on the approved list. Allows entry from EU,
                  Norway, Switzerland, Iceland and Lichtenstein without
                  mandatory testing or quarantine from countries with a maximum
                  of 25 new COVID-19 infections per 100,000 inhabitants. Border
                  control has been reinstated at border crossing points. Borders
                  are open for citizens from Australia, Canada, Georgia, Japan,
                  New Zealand, Rwanda, South Korea, Thailand, Tunisia and
                  Uruguay. Family members of Finnish citizens are allowed to
                  enter Finland regardless of their nationality.

                  The European Council has issued a revised list of countries
                  for which Schengen member states should relax entry
                  restrictions as of August 1. The European Council's
                  recommendation is advisory only, individual member states
                  retain the authority to unilaterally deny travel from
                  countries on the approved list or to permit travel with
                  countries not on the approved list. Countries are divided into
                  three categories, Category A, B, and C: Category A: Australia,
                  Cyprus, Finland, Germany, South Korea, Latvia, Lithuania, New
                  Zealand, and Thailand. Category B: Canada, Belgium, China
                  (PRC), Denmark, Estonia, Georgia, Greece, Hong Kong, Vatican
                  City, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Liechtenstein, Poland,
                  Rwanda, San Marino, Serbia, Slovakia, Sweden, the United
                  Kingdom, and Uruguay. Category C: any country not listed in
                  category A or B. The following passengers are allowed to enter
                  Cyprus from Category C countries: Cypriot citizens permanently
                  residing in the Republic, and their family members; persons
                  legally residing in Cyprus; persons allowed to enter Cyprus in
                  accordance with the Vienna Convention; persons of any
                  nationality who are allowed to enter Cyprus after obtaining
                  special permission from Cyprus, as defined under the

                  so-called "green list") can arrive in the Czech Republic
                  without any restrictions. All other international arrivals
                  require a health certificate declaring them to be COVID-19
                  free or must self-isolate for 14-days. The green-list
                  currently includes the following countries: Andorra,
                  Australia, Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, Estonia, Finland,
                  France, Croatia, Ireland, Iceland, Italy, Japan, Canada, South

                  Republic, San Marnio, Solavakia, Slovenia, Thailand, Tunisia,
                  Sweden, Switzerland, Vatican City, the United Kingdom, and
                  Northern Ireland. Travelers from mid- and high-risk countries
                  may only enter for the reasons specified in the protective
                  measure. They require a health certificate declaring them to
                  be COVID-19 free or must self-isolate for 14-days. EU citizens
                  entering for the purpose of economic activity for a period
                  exceeding 72 hours have to submit a medical certificate. EU
                  citizens entering for the purpose of economic activity for a
                  period exceeding 72 hours must submit a medical certificate.
                  Third-country citizens must submit a medical certificate
                  supplemented by a negative test.

                  Travelers to the UAE must first receive approval from the
                  Federal Authority for Identity and Citizenship through the
                  Twajudi Resident Service. Etihad Airways (EY) is operating
                  repatriation flights through at least June 15, 2020. As of
                  August 12, 2020, residents of the UAE no longer require
                  approval from the Federal Authority for Identity and
                  Citizenship (ICA) to return to the country. The ICA will
                  automatically grant pre-approval for expatriate residents
                  wishing to return without the need to apply for an entry
                  permit. Residents are advised to provide their passport
                  number, Emirates ID number, and personal data. In the past,
                  regulations announced regarding the UAE have not always been
                  applied to Dubai Emirate. Authorities have yet to clarify if
                  this is the case. Residents who hold Dubai-issued visas are
                  permitted to enter on any airline on the condition that they
                  obtain prior approval from the General Directorate of
                  Residency and Foreign Affairs and the airline. Residents who
                  hold Dubai-issued visas are permitted to return to the emirate
                  on any airline on the condition that they obtain prior
                  approval from the General Directorate of Residency and Foreign
                  Affairs and the airline. Effective May 21, 2020, Emirates
                  Airlines (EK) announced they would operate multiple regular,
                  non-repatriation flights to several locations in Europe, the
                  United States, Canada, and Australia through at least June 30,
                  2020. An indefinite prohibition on entry by Gulf Cooperation
                  Council (GCC) nationals is in place. As of June 23, 2020,
                  there are no restrictions on overseas destinations to which
                  citizens and residents of Dubai can travel. All inbound
                  passengers will undergo another COVID-19 test upon arrival to
                  Abu Dhabi. Abu Dhabi residents are allowed to take 48-hour
                  trips to other emirates. Residents must be tested in Abu Dhabi
                  before leaving. Authorities will check results upon returning
                  to Abu Dhabi. If traveling outside of Abu Dhabi for longer
                  than 48 hours, residents will have to take a new test. Anyone
                  wishing to leave the UAE must first obtain a permit from the
                  Federal Authority for Identity and Citizenship (ICA).
                  Travelers are required to present a negative COVID-19 test
                  obtained within the previous 48 hours prior to boarding a
                  flight as well as fill in a health declaration form. Approval
                  to leave the UAE will be granted based on the perceived level
                  of risk in the destination country and the purpose of the
                  journey. International tourists are being permitted to enter
                  Dubai. All travelers to Dubai, including passengers with
                  connecting flights, must complete a health declaration form.

                  days and are able to quarantine for the first 14 days of their
                  stay. Non-essential travel between the US-Canada and US-Mexico
                  land border has been suspended, with the suspension extended
                  to August 21, 2020. Effective March 30, 2020, individuals
                  displaying symptoms associated with coronavirus disease

                  the US to enter Aruba as part of the phased reopening of its
                  air and sea ports. Borders were previously reopened for travel
                  between Aruba, Bonaire, and Curacao, June 15, 2020, and for
                  travelers from Europe, Canada, and the Caribbean (excluding
                  Haiti and the Dominican Republic) July 1, 2020. Travelers from
                  Mexico, Haiti, Dominican Republic, Central America, and South
                  America will remain banned from entering Aruba until further
                  notice. Cargo, emergency, and limited repatriation flights at
                  Queen Beatrix International Airport (AUA) have been exempt
                  from the edict. There are no restrictions on outbound flights
                  from Aruba.

                  Officials are enforcing enhanced health screenings and
                  requirements for all arriving passengers. Stricter
                  requirements are being enforced for travelers from US states
                  with a high incidence of COVID-19 cases. Travelers from these
                  states have to provide proof of a negative COVID-19 test prior
                  to traveling to Aruba via the digital
                  Embarkation-Disembarkation Card (ED card), they will not be
                  able to use testing facilities at the airport upon arrival.
                  These states are: • Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California,
                  Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana,
                  Mississippi, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon,
                  South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah,
                  Wisconsin, and Wyoming. Travelers from the remaining states
                  and permitted countries are not required to submit proof of a
                  valid negative COVID-19 test prior to arrival, however, if
                  they choose not to do a test prior to travel they will be
                  subject to obligatory testing at the airport at the travelers’
                  expense. The traveler will then be subject to a mandatory
                  24-hour quarantine at the traveler’s accommodation while
                  awaiting test results. Passengers who decline to take the test
                  and those who test positive for COVID-19 will be quarantined
                  at an approved location.

                  The European Council has issued a revised list of countries
                  for which Schengen member states should relax entry
                  restrictions as of August 1, 2020. The European Council's
                  recommendation is advisory only, individual member states
                  retain the authority to unilaterally deny travel from
                  countries on the approved list or to permit travel with
                  countries not on the approved list. Allows entry for citizens
                  from EU countries, Norway, Switzerland, Iceland,
                  Liechtenstein, Andorra, Monaco, Vatican City and San Marino,
                  without restrictions, as long as the countries are not
                  classified as "high risk" areas. International arrivals from
                  Austraila, Canada, Georgia, Japan, New Zealand, Rwanda, South
                  Korea, Thailand, Tunisia, Uruguay, and China (PRC) (subject to
                  confirmation of reciprocity) are allowed to enter Greece
                  without restrictions. Upon arrival travelers from Russia must
                  perform a negative rt-PCR test certificate in English and
                  provide the hotel reservation, or any other proved address of
                  their temporary stay in Greece. Before entering the country,
                  all travelers must complete a Passenger Locator Form.
                  Permantent residents of other third countries are only allowed
                  to enter Greece for essential reasons (not tourism).

                  health declaration to be completed before boarding at the port

                  Effective March 19, 2020, travelers who have been to any
                  overseas countries/territories in the past 14 days, regardless
                  of whether they are Hong Kong residents, are subject to
                  compulsory quarantine of 14 days. Effective from April 22,
                  2020, all asymptomatic inbound travelers are required to take
                  shuttle bus from Hong Kong International Airport immediately
                  to the temporary specimen collection center at AsiaWorld-Expo
                  (AWE) to collect deep throat saliva samples in accordance with
                  the instructions and submit the samples to the Department of
                  Health personnel at the venue for conducting COVID-19 test.
                  They are also mandated to wait for test results at a
                  designated location. Effective 25 July 2020, passengers who
                  have been in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan,
                  Philippines or South Africa in the past 14 days must have a
                  medical certificate with a negative Coronavirus (COVID-19)
                  test result issued at most 72 hours before departure. The
                  certificate must be in Chinese or English. The same measure
                  applies to travelers from Kazakhstan and the US as from July
                  29, 2020. All arrivals from these high-risk countries will be
                  required to undergo a two-week quarantine in
                  government-designated hotels. This does not apply to
                  passengers in transit. Effective July 29, 2020, inbound ship
                  crews and flight crew members will have to obtain a negative
                  COVID-19 test result within 48 hours of departure for Hong
                  Kong.

                  Land border crossings with China (PRC) to the Shenzhen Bay
                  checkpoint and along the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge are
                  restricted. Immigration processing centers at Ocean Terminal
                  and Kai Tak Cruise Terminal remain closed. Hong Kong
                  International Airport (HKG) remains open. Some flight transits
                  are allowed at HKG if passengers' itineraries are grouped in a
                  single booking, and the connection time is less than 24 hours.
                  From 00:01 July 23, 2020, officials are requiring individuals
                  to wear protective face coverings in all indoor public areas,
                  including shopping centers and supermarkets. However, the
                  measure does not apply to office spaces. Residents also must
                  wear face coverings on all forms of public transport.
                  Effective July 29, 2020, quarantine measures for sea and
                  aircrews will be tighten indefinitely. Ships without cargo
                  cannot exchange crews. On other ships, workers are no longer
                  allowed to enter the territory and must travel directly to the
                  airport after disembarking if completing their service
                  onboard. Airlines and shipping companies must arrange
                  point-to-point transport for employees to limit interaction
                  with the public. Hong Kong authorities have extended ongoing
                  restrictions through at least August 11, 2020.

                  from medium-risk will be granted the rapid COVID-19 test but

                  reapply for Chinese visas if they are already in possession of
                  a valid Chinese residence permit. Authorities are issuing new
                  visas for South Koreans who have valid Chinese residence
                  permits, Z (work) visas, or who plan to study in China.
                  Specially designated foreign workers with invitation letters
                  issued by provincial or municipal government officials in
                  China are being allowed to apply for visas and authorized to
                  reenter the country. Effective April 8, 2020, Wuhan Tianhe
                  International Airport will resume operation except flights to
                  and from Beijing. Travelers arriving in Beijing from high-risk
                  areas in China (PRC) will be subject to 14-day quarantine,
                  while no quarantine requirement for travelers from low-risk
                  areas if they can provide a green QR code. Employers are still
                  required to report to the landlord or local neighborhood
                  council about any employees arriving from overseas and
                  high-risk areas in China (PRC). Effective, June 16, 2020,
                  controls and transport restrictions in Beijing have been
                  expanded. Districts such as Fengtai, Chaoyang, Daxing, and
                  Mentougou are placed under “war time” restrictions. In most
                  other cities, domestic arrival will not be subject to
                  mandatory quarantine if they can provide a green QR code.
                  Beginning June 8, 2020, essential business travel from
                  Singapore under a fast-track arrangement is allowed. The Civil
                  Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) is allowing more
                  international commercial flights to operate. CAAC will limit
                  total international flights. Business travelers testing
                  negative will adhere to a pre-agreed itinerary and refrain
                  from using public transport, except for private hire vehicles,
                  for the first 14 days. The travelers will have to download and
                  use a health pass while in the country.

                  Travelers who have been in high-risk countries are required to
                  bring negative COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test
                  results with them to present upon arrival, or to take a test
                  and remain at the airport or a government facility until the
                  results are available. Persons with negative tests are
                  required to undergo 14 days of quarantine, with the option of
                  taking a second COVID-19 test 5-7 days after the first test.
                  Persons will typically be released from quarantine once the
                  second test result comes back negative. Travelers who have
                  been in medium-risk countries will be allowed to leave the
                  airport immediately if they present negative results to a
                  COVID-19 PCR test. These persons will be subject to daily
                  health monitoring for a period of 14 days. Persons who elect
                  to take a second test 5-7 days after arrival and test
                  negative, will not be subject to further monitoring. Travelers
                  who have been in low-risk countries are required to either
                  bring negative results of a COVID-19 PCR test or take a test
                  upon arrival. Such persons will be allowed to leave the
                  airport upon validation of negative results. All travelers
                  must complete and submit a customs form with health screening
                  questions at least 24 hours prior to their arrival. Masks must
                  be worn at all times while at the airport.

                  large-scale social distancing measures, known as PSBB, have
                  been implemented.

                  All scheduled international commercial passenger services will
                  remain closed until October 31, 2020. Until then, no
                  international aircraft will be allowed to disembark passengers
                  (including citizens) in India, with the following exception.
                  From May 7, 2020, the Indian government has been evacuating
                  stranded Indian citizens in a phased manner from several
                  countries on special flights. On May 22, 2020, the Government
                  of India announced that the following categories of Overseas
                  Citizens of India (OCI) cardholders may travel to India on
                  special evacuation flights. (1) Minor children who are born to
                  Indian nationals abroad and who hold valid OCI cards; (2) OCI
                  cardholders who wish to come to India on account of family
                  emergencies; (3) University students who are OCI cardholders
                  (not minors) and whose parents are Indian citizens living in
                  India; and (4) Couples where one spouse is an OCI cardholder
                  and the other is an Indian national and who permanently reside
                  in India. The Indian government is permitting entry of foreign
                  nationals with a fresh or renewed business visa as of June 15,
                  2020. Authorized travelers include those with the managerial
                  and technical expertise required by a foreign entity located
                  in India or an Indian entity providing a letter of invitation,
                  others include Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) cardholders and
                  foreign nationals related to OCI cardholders or Indian
                  citizens. Family members of those in India with diplomatic,
                  official, or UN/international organizations visas are also
                  permitted to enter India. Such travelers must approach Indian
                  consulates for fresh visas regardless of previous visa status
                  and may enter the country via non-scheduled flights due to an
                  ongoing ban on commercial international passenger flights
                  through June 30, 2020. Anyone who qualifies for an evacuation
                  flight must register with the Indian consular post in their
                  jurisdiction and only travel to India on the designated
                  flight. While there is no specific announcement regarding
                  departure of flights from India, they are virtually at a
                  standstill. Indian officials are maintaining a ban on
                  travelers from Afghanistan, the EU, the European Free Trade
                  Association, Malaysia, Philippines, Turkey, and the United
                  Kingdom. The government has announced limited operations of
                  international commercial flights with France, Germany, Qatar,
                  Maldives, UAE, UK and the US from September 1, 2020. Entry
                  will be limited to: Indian citizens; Overseas Citizens of
                  India (OCI); cardholders and their relatives; business
                  travelers other than those with B-3 sporting visas; holders of
                  diplomatic, official, or UN/international organization visas
                  and their family members. Similar measures may be implemented
                  with Germany and the UK in the near future.

                  and who have made an application to exit the country, will be
                  granted an Exit Permit without being subject to any penalty
                  for overstay. Visa-on-arrival suspended for nationals of Japan
                  and South Korea. Travelers (once international flights are
                  permitted to land) who arrive from or have been in Italy or
                  South Korea with a visa issued after March 5, 2020 by India

                  suspension of international cruises, passenger buses, and
                  train services continues. The nightly 22:00-05:00 curfew will
                  be lifted as at August 1, 2020, however, regional variations
                  are almost certain to continue. Several areas in north India

                  August 31, 2020.

                  Effective April 13, 2020, visa waiver/visa-free privileges of
                  nationals of 90 countries will be suspended; these include
                  Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, many European
                  countries, and Canada. However, the effective date of
                  suspension can vary by country because some visa exemption
                  treaties require a notice period to elapse before a suspension
                  can take effect. The government ended travel restrictions on
                  foreign nationals who visited Hubei Province, China, as at
                  August 10, 2020. Nationals of China (PRC) with a passport
                  issued in the Hubei Province are not allowed to enter South
                  Korea. Korean visas issued by the Wuhan Consulate in the Hubei
                  Province are invalidated. A visa is required to transit
                  through South Korea for nationals of China (PRC). Nationals of
                  Japan who do not hold a Korean visa issued on or after March
                  9, 2020 will not be allowed entry. Foreign travelers not
                  entering Korea are allowed to transfer without a visa unless:
                  they departed from China, they have been to Hubei in the last
                  14 days, or their passports or visa were issued in Hubei.
                  Visas for foreign nationals from Pakistan and Bangladesh have
                  been suspended. As from September 4, 2020, "fast track" entry
                  for essential business trips and official travel from
                  Singapore are allowed.

                  Effective April 1, 2020, travelers including foreign
                  residents, short term visitors (regardless of nationality) and
                  South Korean citizens entering South Korea are subject to
                  mandatory quarantine of 2 weeks. Foreigners who arrive with a
                  non-professional employment visa are required to have
                  residences where they can self-quarantine for 14 days.
                  Passengers arriving from any country will be subject to
                  quarantine procedures. They must install a self-diagnosis
                  application in their personal device and a completed Health
                  Declaration Form and a Special Quarantine Declaration Form
                  must be presented to the quarantine desk upon arrival.
                  Effective April 2, 2020, all inbound international passengers,
                  who have suspected symptoms and intend to stay in the city,
                  are required to undergo COVID-19 tests upon arrival. Officials
                  will send arriving passengers that exhibit COVID-19 symptoms
                  to designated quarantine facilities for testing. Travelers
                  with COVID-19 symptoms will be screened immediately, while
                  other passengers will be screened at designated testing
                  facilities in Seoul. Mandatory screenings are ongoing for
                  international arrivals at all ports of entry, and testing is
                  likely for symptomatic passengers. From June 1, 2020, foreign
                  nationals with long-term visas who wish to return to South
                  Korea after traveling abroad must obtain re-entry permits
                  before departing the country and present medical screenings
                  with proof of a negative COVID-19 test result before returning
                  to South Korea. Inbound foreign nationals are required to
                  provide proof of a negative PCR COVID-19 test upon entry. All
                  arriving travelers from the United States and Europe must
                  undergo COVID-19 testing within 3 days of arrival. Officials
                  will send arriving passengers that exhibit COVID-19 symptoms
                  to designated quarantine facilities for testing. Passengers
                  who have been in Bangladesh, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan,
                  Philippines or Uzbekistan in the past 14 days must have a
                  medical certificate with a negative Coronavirus (COVID-19) PCR
                  test result issued at most 48 hours before departure. The
                  certificate must be in English. Nationals of South Korea are
                  exempt. Merchant seamen with a visa must have a medical
                  certificate with a negative Coronavirus (COVID-19) PCR test
                  result issued at most 48 hours before departure. The
                  certificate must be in English and passengers must have two
                  copies of the certificate.

                  Authorities have extended nationwide Level 2 restrictions
                  through at least September 27, 2020. South Korean officials
                  have lifted so-called Level 2.5 controls in Greater Seoul amid
                  ongoing COVID-19 activity. ​ Effective June 23, 2020, South
                  Korean authorities will limit visa and entry restrictions for
                  passengers traveling from six countries, including Bangladesh,
                  Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Pakistan. This does not apply to
                  diplomatic travelers and people traveling for urgent business
                  reasons. Effective June 1, 2020, ARC holders (with limited
                  exemptions) must obtain re-entry permission before departing
                  South Korea. ARC holders (with limited exemptions) returning
                  to South Korea must obtain a medical diagnosis/clearance in
                  English within 48 hours of boarding the return flight.
                  Effective April 13, 2020, short-term consular visas issued on
                  or before April 5, 2020 will be invalidated; this does not
                  apply to C-4 short-term employment visas or long-term work
                  visas. ARCs of foreign residents (with some exception) are
                  automatically extended for three months from the current
                  expiry date, so long as the holder is in South Korea as of
                  April 9, 2020 and the ARC expiry date falls between April 9
                  and May 31, 2020 (both dates inclusive). Visas issued to
                  nationals of Japan (at Korean Diplomatic Missions in Japan)
                  before March 9, 2020 are invalidated. This does not apply to
                  visas issued outside Japan. Such visas remain valid. Visa-free
                  entry to Jeju Island is temporarily suspended to all foreign
                  nationals. Visa-free and visa-waiver programs have been halted
                  with countries that have entry bans for South Korean citizens.
                  The restriction impacts travelers from 90 countries, including
                  Australia, Canada, and most European nations.

                  and missionary activities, and job searches, among others.
                  Residents from Hong Kong and Macau can also apply for entry
                  for humanitarian and emergency reasons, to fulfill contractual
                  agreements, or as part of a transfer within multinationals. As
                  of July 10, 2020 entry requirements have been further relaxed
                  for select foreign nationals. Hong Kong and Macau citizens
                  with residence permits and foreigners possessing an Alien
                  Resident Certificate (ARC) will be permitted to enter the
                  country without a negative COVID-19 test.​ ​ Inbound travel
                  for tourism and social reasons remains banned.

                  airports where flights from high-risk countries were required
                  to land are no longer in place. This does not change or lessen

                  have visited Brazil, China (PRC), Iran, Ireland, the United

                  in the past 14 days. By Presidential Proclamation, effective
                  April 23, 2020, and expanded by additional Presidential
                  Proclamation effective June 24, 2020, issuance of immigrant
                  visas (for US permanent residency) to individuals outside the
                  United States is paused until December 31, 2020. The US State
                  Department has lowered its travel alert for US citizens from
                  Level 4 (Do Not Travel), the highest advisory level, for many
                  travel destinations on a country-by-country basis. Many travel
                  alerts are now Level 3 (Reconsider Travel), but travelers
                  should check the Department of State website to determine the
                  travel alert for their specific destination. All US embassies
                  and consulates have begun processing some routine visa
                  services but restrictions and closures continue to apply on a
                  location-specific basis. As resources allow, embassies and
                  consulates will continue to provide emergency and mission
                  critical visa services. Most major airlines have cancelled or
                  reduced flights to China, Iran, Italy, Japan, and South Korea.

                  The European Council has issued a revised list of countries
                  for which Schengen member states should relax entry
                  restrictions as of September 1, 2020. The list includes
                  Canada, Georgia, Japan, New Zealand, Rwanda, South Korea,
                  Thailand, Tunisia, Uruguay, and China (PRC) (provided China
                  implements a reciprocal travel arrangement). The European
                  Council's recommendation is advisory only, individual member
                  states retain the authority to unilaterally deny travel from
                  countries on the approved list or to permit travel with
                  countries not on the approved list.​ This isn’t decided or
                  published from the Romania government yet.

                  Passengers traveling on business, as experts, must have an

                  be taken at the laboratory of the authorized medical
                  authority. Permitted inbound passengers must also quarantine

                  continuously in specified countries and regions can

                  The European Council has issued a revised list of countries
                  for which Schengen member states should relax entry
                  restrictions as of September 1, 2020. The list includes
                  Canada, Georgia, Japan, New Zealand, Rwanda, South Korea,
                  Thailand, Tunisia, Uruguay and China (PRC) (provided China
                  implements a reciprocal travel arrangement). The European
                  Council's recommendation is advisory only, individual member
                  states retain the authority to unilaterally deny travel from
                  countries on the approved list or to permit travel with
                  countries not on the approved list.​ ​

                  Extending enhanced community quarantine in high-risk areas,
                  including Metro Manila, through September 30, 2020.
                  Authorities imposed a 22:00 -05:00 nightly curfew in Metro
                  Manila through at least August 31, 2020. All visas, including
                  previously issued documents and visa-free privileges remain
                  suspended. The central government has lifted a ban on
                  nonessential outbound travel. People traveling overseas will
                  have to comply with health protocols, including having travel
                  health insurance that covers rebooking and accommodation
                  expenses and signing a declaration form acknowledging travel
                  risks. Authorities plan to allow long-term visa holders to
                  re-enter the Philippines from August 1, 2020. These travelers
                  will need to adhere to several protocols, including having
                  pre-booked a quarantine facility and a COVID-19 testing
                  provider in the Philippines. Other types of previously issued
                  visas and visa-free privileges are suspended. Previously
                  issued visas to foreign travelers have been cancelled. Visas
                  that have been issued to foreign spouses and children of
                  Filipino nationals, as well as foreign government and
                  international organization officials, remain valid. Inbound
                  international flights have resumed. Officials have restricted
                  incoming international commercial flights at Manila's Ninoy
                  Aquino International Airport (MNL) to Tuesdays, Wednesdays,
                  Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. Domestic flights resumed from
                  June 3, 2020. Overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) and uniformed
                  personnel on official duty can continue traveling overseas.

                  People identified as persons of interest based on screening
                  measures may be denied entry, asked to undergo a 14-day
                  self-quarantine, or may be subjected to government-imposed
                  quarantine at a designated health facility. Passengers are
                  required to provide health declarations and travel history
                  information before entering the country. As of July 23, 2020,
                  authorities require all persons entering the country to have
                  tested negative for COVID-19 within seven days prior to
                  travel. Passengers are also required to obtain written
                  approval from the National Pandemic Controller’s Office.
                  Officials have intensified health screenings. Most inbound
                  passengers must quarantine for 14 days in Port Moresby. The
                  government allows passengers who have spent the previous seven
                  days in Australia (except Victoria), New Zealand, the Solomon
                  Islands, and several South Pacific nations to undergo seven
                  days of quarantine at designated facilities, or at home.
                  Permission is required to self-quarantine. Immigration and
                  customs officials also require health declarations and travel
                  history information before allowing passengers into the
                  country. Staff at Jacksons International Airport (POM) and
                  other ports of entry are using thermal scanners to monitor
                  patients for possible symptoms.

                  As of September 13, 2020, foreigners who hold work or
                  permanent residency permits, including foreign spouses of
                  Malaysian citizens, are allowed to enter Malaysia from 23
                  countries that fall within the 150,000-case category, provided
                  they have obtained approval from Malaysian authorities and
                  will be remaining in the country permanently. The 23 countries
                  for which the ban has been eased are: Argentina, Bangladesh,
                  Brazil, Chile, Colombia, France, Germany, India, Indonesia,
                  Italy, Iran, Iraq, Mexico, Pakistan, Peru, Philippines,
                  Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Spain, Turkey, the United
                  Kingdom, and the United States. Malaysian nationals remain
                  banned from traveling abroad while the restrictions are in
                  place. Malaysian and Singaporean authorities plan to allow
                  limited cross-border travel for some groups of people from
                  August 10, 2020. Passengers transiting in Malaysia will be
                  allowed to do so as long as they do not need to clear
                  immigration to board their connecting flight. The government
                  relaxed an entry ban that it had earlier imposed on travelers
                  arriving from nations having over 150,000 COVID-19 cases.
                  Foreigners from these locations who hold work or permanent
                  residency permits, including foreign spouses of Malaysian
                  citizens, are allowed to enter Malaysia, provided they have

                  Travelers must test for COVID-19 upon arrival. Those who test

                  those who test negative will quarantine for 14 days at

                  authorities before being sent to designated government
                  quarantine centers around Negeri Sembilan and Selangor.
                  Travelers with onward domestic connections must undergo the
                  mandatory 14-day quarantine before being allowed to proceed to
                  their domestic destinations. However, passengers with
                  connections to Sabah and Sarawak (both East Malaysia) are
                  allowed to undergo quarantine upon arrival in their respective
                  states. These travelers are not allowed to leave the airport
                  building and must have a transit time of less than 24 hours.
                  Airline crew arriving in Malaysia are subject to quarantine
                  until their next flight; and must install 'MySejahtera app' on

                  whose final destinations are either Kuching, Sibu, Bintulu, or
                  Miru districts. All non-resident Malaysians arriving in the

                  Quarantine measures for arriving travelers are no longer
                  mandatory. Residents of French Polynesia must have a “Carte de
                  resident" with a validity of 10 years. Non-residents must have
                  an International Travel Certificate to enter and transit
                  French Polynesia. The certificate must be obtained before
                  departure via the French consular offices abroad or online at
                  https://www.interieur.gouv.fr. For international inbound
                  travelers (who will be allowed entry from July 15, 2020), they
                  will not be required to undergo quarantine, but they will have
                  to provide a polymerase chain reaction test within 72 hours of
                  traveling to French Polynesia, a medical certificate, and for
                  nonresident travelers to have international travel insurance.
                  Travelers are also required to present a receipt of health
                  registration of the Electronic Travel Information System
                  (Etis.pf). Arriving passengers are required to test themselves
                  four days after arrival, using testing kits provided to them
                  as they disembark from the plane. If they test positive they
                  will have to report to a health center.

                  All arrivals, regardless of nationality, have to undergo
                  14-day quarantine after entering Fiji. Arrivals from Australia
                  and New Zealand can provide documentation verifying that they
                  spent 14 days in quarantine in their home country, and tested
                  negative for COVID-19 within 48 hours of departing for Fiji,
                  which will allow them to avoid a strict quarantine, but still

                  Only New Zealand residents, citizens (and their accompanying
                  children and partners), and selected foreign nationals are
                  permitted to enter New Zealand. This includes the Realm
                  countries (the Cook Islands, Niue, Tokelau), Australian
                  citizens and permanent residents ordinarily resident in New
                  Zealand, airline and marine crew. An entry ban for most
                  foreign nationals remains in place, however, officials lifted
                  a requirement for partners and dependents of citizens to
                  return to the country together, provided they have a visa
                  based on the relationship or usually reside in New Zealand.
                  Such travelers and diplomats posted in New Zealand can enter
                  the country without prior consent from the government.
                  Authorities permit partners, dependents, and legal guardians
                  of citizens without visas to enter the country. Entry is also
                  possible for humanitarian reasons, Australian citizens and
                  permanent residents that live in New Zealand, and Samoan and
                  Tongan citizens on essential trips approved by their
                  governments. Critical workers are permitted to travel to New
                  Zealand on short-term visas valid up to six months. Companies
                  must apply for a visa and demonstrate that the worker's
                  technical skills are unobtainable within the country, or they
                  are working on infrastructure projects. Some long-term,
                  essential workers who meet short-term entrance criteria and
                  earn twice the median salary in the country or participate in
                  a government-backed event are allowed to enter. The government
                  requires people from these groups to receive permission before
                  traveling to the country and will review applications for
                  travel on a case-by-case basis. Transit is only allowed in
                  Auckland for maximum 24 hours.

                  Effective April 9, 2020, all travelers entering New Zealand
                  must remain at government designated facilities for 14 days
                  upon arrival. All inbound travelers are subject to health
                  screenings and quarantine at government-designated facilities
                  for 14 days. New Zealand has instituted a quarantine fee
                  structure for inbound travelers as of August 11, 2020. Under
                  the program, most travelers allowed into the country will have
                  to pay NZD 3,100 (USD 2,050) for the first person and NZD 950
                  (USD 628) for each additional adult and NZD 475 (USD 314) per
                  additional child. Officials do not charge for children under
                  three years of age if they are staying with another person.
                  New Zealand citizens, residence visa holders, and Australian
                  citizens and permanent residents who typically reside in New
                  Zealand, are exempt from costs, provided they departed before
                  August 11, 2020, and intend to stay in the country longer than
                  90 days upon their return. Temporary visa holders are also
                  exempt from fees if they were residents in New Zealand as at
                  March 19, 2020, and were outside the country before that date.
                  Companies can cover the quarantine costs for inbound critical
                  workers. The government has also introduced a bill in
                  Parliament that would require travelers to pay for quarantine
                  costs, with exceptions. However, it is unclear if or when the
                  regulation will take effect. Quarantined passengers must test
                  negative for COVID-19 and undergo two additional tests before
                  departing facilities. Authorities have also extended the ban
                  on cruise ships entering New Zealand ports, cargo and fishing
                  vessels will be allowed to load and unload and undertake
                  repairs. Vessel crews arriving in New Zealand are required to
                  spend 14 days in quarantine unless they had been on the vessel
                  for 28 days before docking at the port.

                  Effective June 9, 2020, the COVID-19 alert will be lowered to
                  Level 1. Under Level 1, authorities will lift most domestic
                  restrictions. Air New Zealand (NZ) has extended a suspension
                  of new inbound bookings through at least August 9, 2020. The
                  government is reportedly working with NZ to create a voucher
                  system for new arrivals, and further extensions are possible
                  until the measure is in place. Authorities are maintaining the
                  alert for COVID-19 at Level 1, though domestic measures -
                  including transport restrictions - have ended. New Zealand
                  authorities have extended restrictions nationwide through at
                  least 23:59 September 21, 2020. Holders of a work, student,
                  visitor, limited or interim visa with an expiry date of April
                  2 to July 9, 2020 inclusive who are in New Zealand on April 2,
                  2020 will have their visas automatically extended to September
                  25, 2020. Offshore visa applications for temporary visas are
                  not being processed.

                  Nationals and residents of Maldives will be subject to 14-day
                  quarantine upon arrival. All passengers traveling for a
                  purpose other than tourism will be quarantined for 14 days at
                  a government-designated location. A completed "Health
                  Declaration Card" and an "Immigration Arrival Card" must be
                  presented upon arrival. Maldivian citizens arriving from the
                  United States will be quarantined at a designated facility for
                  14 days. Inbound foreign travelers must reserve accommodation
                  at one resort approved by the Ministry of Tourism for the
                  duration of their stay in the Maldives, outside of sites such
                  as eateries and tourist spots. Officials have said mandatory
                  quarantine and testing will not be necessary for asymptomatic
                  travelers from July 15, 2020. However, regulations may vary
                  based on a passenger's nationality and travel history, and
                  authorities can rescind, delay, or alter planned resumptions
                  of international travel at short notice. Beginning September
                  10, 2020, authorities in the Maldives will require all
                  tourists and short-term visitors arriving in the country to
                  present a negative COVID-19 test result upon arrival. The test
                  must be taken no more than 72 hours before departing to the
                  Maldives. Inbound foreign travelers must reserve
                  accommodations at either one resort or a maximum of two
                  different approved resorts, where they are to spend their
                  entire time in the Maldives, except when visiting dining
                  facilities and recreation venues approved by the Ministry of
                  Tourism. While there is no mandatory quarantine for
                  asymptomatic travelers, all persons entering the country must
                  submit an online health declaration via the "Imuga" portal
                  within 24 hours before travel. ​ Effective September 28, 2020,
                  asymptomatic entrants with medical certification indicating
                  they have recovered from COVID-19 within 90 days before
                  arrival may be exempt from testing and quarantine.

                  Authorities in Macau are requiring travelers from Hong Kong to
                  provide evidence of negative COVID-19 test results taken
                  within 72 hours prior to arrival as of early August​ 2020. All
                  Macao residents who have been in Schengen Area, the United
                  Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Brazil, Egypt, Australia,
                  South Korea, Japan, Iran, and New Zealand in the past 14 days
                  are subject to quarantine for 14 days. Residents and travelers
                  who visited Hong Kong, Taiwan, and other countries are allowed
                  to self-isolate at home. As of 14 June, 2020, Macau and Zhuhai
                  have eased quarantine requirements for some travel. Officials
                  are permitting Macau citizens that live in Zhuhai with
                  residency permits to cross the border without quarantine
                  requirements, after applying for an exemption. Macau teachers
                  and students residing in Zhuhai do not have to apply for the
                  exemption. Travelers must receive approval from health
                  authorities via an online application and undergo a nucleic
                  acid test for COVID-19 within 48 hours of traveling to Zhuhai.
                  People receiving approval can travel across the border an
                  unlimited number of times within seven days but cannot leave
                  Guangdong. Effective June 23, 2020, nonresident workers in
                  Zhuhai entering the territory must obtain confirmation of
                  their residence from Zhuhai officials, show a green Macau
                  health code, and provide evidence of a negative COVID-19
                  nucleic acid test within seven days of entering the territory.
                  Officials will also allow some workers to enter Macau if their
                  COVID-19 test was within the past 24 hours. Macau has lifted
                  quarantine requirements for nonresident workers that live in
                  Zhuhai, Guangdong Province as of June 24, 2020. Macau
                  authorities have lifted quarantine requirements for travelers
                  from Beijing, as of July 15, 2020. The move effectively ends
                  quarantine for all inbound mainland Chinese citizens.
                  Officials also ended a requirement that arrivals with a travel
                  history in Hubei Province within the previous two weeks
                  provide evidence of negative COVID-19 status. Travelers must
                  still receive approval from Macau health authorities via an
                  online application, complete a travel and health declaration,
                  hold a green health code, and provide evidence of a negative
                  nucleic acid COVID-19 test valid for seven days. Thermal
                  scanners are in place at all entry points into Macau.
                  Travelers from mainland China can enter Macau without
                  quarantine or medical certificates proving negative COVID-19
                  status.

                  Macau is allowing residents to travel to Zhuhai, Guangdong
                  Province for official reasons, essential business activity,
                  and emergencies, without quarantine for up to 14 days.
                  Travelers must receive approval from health authorities via an
                  online application and undergo a nucleic acid test for
                  COVID-19 within 48 hours of traveling to Zhuhai. Approved
                  people can travel across the border an unlimited number of
                  times within seven days but cannot leave Guangdong. Returning
                  residents from Hong Kong must register online with the Higher
                  Education Bureau within 48 hours of their landing and plan to
                  arrive at HKG 04:00-22:00. Returning travelers from Hong Kong
                  must also provide documentation from the government and proof
                  of residency before boarding ferries for Macau.

                  immediate family members of Kuwaiti citizens traveling
                  together). Effective March 13, 2020, the Kuwait International
                  Airport has been closed until further notice to all inbound
                  commercial flights except for arriving Kuwaiti citizens and
                  their immediate relatives traveling with them. Since April 11,
                  2020, Kuwait International Airport has re-opened only to allow
                  airlines to operate a limited number of outbound flights.
                  Kuwait has closed its airport and land border with Iraq.
                  Effective June 30, 2020, authorities approved plans to resume
                  commercial flights from Kuwait International Airport (KWI)
                  from August 1, 2020. Commercial flights to and from 31
                  countries, including but not limited to Bangladesh, Egypt,
                  Philippines, India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Iran, and Nepal,
                  remain suspended until further notice. Kuwaiti sea ports have
                  been prohibited from receiving foreign vessels arriving from
                  or departing to several foreign countries, including mainland
                  China, Hong Kong, and Iran.

                  Per the US State Department, Kuwait Ministerial Decision 288
                  dated March 26, 2020 gives the option to foreign nationals,
                  including US citizens, who, as of March 1, 2020, did not have
                  a residence permit or whose residency had expired, to depart
                  Kuwait between April 1 and April 30, 2020 without paying a
                  fine. The Ministry of Interior has announced that Article 22
                  (dependent) and Article 24 (self-employed) visa holders can
                  renew their resident permits online. Residents may now also
                  extend their temporary residence visa (Article 14) online for
                  three months for a KD 3 fee. The Embassy is engaging with the
                  Kuwaiti government on how Ministerial Decision 288 applies to
                  tourist visa holders. A further Ministerial Decree 355/2020
                  granted a temporary visa extension through May 31, 2020 for
                  individuals on all types of entry visas. In addition, all
                  tourist visas and residencies are now extended through August
                  31, 2020. All commercial flights to and from Kuwait are
                  suspended until further notice. Commercial flights from Kuwait
                  International Airport (KWI) will be resumed from August 1,
                  2020. Protective face coverings must be worn in public.
                  Violators may face fines or imprisonment of up to three
                  months.

                  Authorities in Jordan will postpone the resumption of
                  international commercial flights from certain approved
                  countries at airports nationwide until September 8, 2020.
                  Authorities in Jordan have established a three-tier
                  color-coded system for classifying foreign countries according
                  to COVID-19 activity as part of preparations for the planned
                  September 8, 2020, resumption of international commercial
                  flights at Queen Alia International Airport (AMM). Under the
                  new system, the green designation denotes that the country has
                  low COVID-19 activity, yellow and red designations indicate
                  moderate and high activity, respectively: On September 15,
                  2020, authorities in Jordan provided an updated list of
                  country classifications for flight arrivals to the Kingdom
                  according to the originating country's COVID-19 activity
                  levels. Green: Algeria, Austria, Canada, Cyprus, Denmark,
                  Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, Italy, Lithuania,
                  Malaysia, Poland, Thailand, Tunisia, and Turkey. Yellow:
                  Egypt, Malta, Morocco, the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, Sudan,
                  Switzerland, Syria, United Arab Emirates, UK, and Yemen. Red:
                  Bahrain, Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Iraq, Israel,
                  Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Oman, Palestinian Territories, Qatar,
                  Romania, Russia, Spain, Ukraine, and the United States. Land
                  and sea borders remain closed to passenger travel. On
                  September 27, 2020, Jordan reopened the Nasib-Jaber border
                  crossing with Syria to trade.

                  All travelers who arrived in Jordan after March 16, 2020 would
                  be quarantined for 14 days. All travelers entering Jordan must
                  present proof of having tested negative for COVID-19 no more
                  than five days before their scheduled flight, as well as proof
                  that they spent the 14 days prior to travel in the country
                  from which they are departing. Beginning September 23, 2020,
                  authorities plan to ease quarantine restrictions for all
                  arrivals. Travelers arriving from “green” countries who test
                  negative for COVID-19 upon arrival will be allowed entry
                  without self-quarantining. Travelers arriving from “yellow”
                  and “red” countries will no longer be required to quarantine
                  at a government-run facility, instead, these travelers will
                  self-quarantine at their residence or accommodations for one
                  week. Travelers from “red” countries will be required to wear
                  an electronic bracelet during the home quarantine period.
