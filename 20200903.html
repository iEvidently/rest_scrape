                  Effective April 17, 2020, Egyptian authorities resumed the
                  closure of the Gazan-Egyptian Rafah border crossing.
                  Egyptian's Rafah border crossing with the Gaza Strip reopened
                  between August 11, and 13, 2020, to permit the repatriation of
                  travelers on both sides of the border who had been stranded
                  due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. A state of
                  emergency has been extended in the West Bank through at least
                  September 4, 2020. A lockdown will be imposed on all West Bank
                  towns and governorates through at least July 26, 2020.
                  Authorities in the Gaza Strip have extended their existing
                  24-hour curfew until further notice.

                  A state of emergency has been declared. Libya's UN-recognized
                  government in Tripoli imposed a four-day complete lockdown as
                  of August 26, 2020. Following the four-day lockdown,
                  authorities will continue to impose a nightly 2021:00-06:00
                  curfew, with a 24-hour curfew in effect on Fridays and
                  Saturdays. The GNA has also imposed a complete curfew in areas
                  captured from the self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA) in
                  southern Libya. Libya's Tripoli-based internationally
                  recognized Government of National Accord (GNA) has announced
                  plans to resume flights at Mitiga International Airport (MJI)
                  beginning August 9, 2020.

                  Entry requirements into Tunisia vary depending on the
                  prevalence of COVID-19 in a traveler's country of origin.
                  Authorities have classified countries as green, orange, or
                  red. Arrivals from green countries are not required to take a
                  test before departing to Tunisia or self-isolate upon arrival.
                  Arrivals from orange countries are required to take a COVID-19
                  test 72 hours before departure, quarantine for at least 14
                  days upon arrival, and sign a declaration to abide by these
                  measures. Tunisians are requested to self-isolate for 14 days
                  at home. Travelers from red countries are not permitted entry
                  unless they are Tunisian nationals or residents. Authorities
                  will place such persons in mandatory quarantine for seven
                  days. Effective August 26, 2020, arriving passengers must have
                  a medical certificate with negative Coronavirus PCR test
                  result issued at most 120 hours before arrival. A completed
                  Health Declaration form must be presented before boarding and
                  to the Immigration upon arrival. All arriving passengers are
                  subject to quarantine of 14 days.

                  Authorities in England will lift a mandatory quarantine
                  requirement for arrivals from e.g. Australia, Germany, Italy,
                  and New Zealand. Authorities in Northern Ireland, Scotland,
                  and Wales are responsible for setting their own quarantine
                  requirements, Scotland and Wales have so far not confirmed
                  that they will be amending their regulations, though Northern
                  Ireland currently plans to maintain quarantine for all
                  international arrivals other than those from Ireland. All
                  international arrivals to the UK must provide contact details,
                  as well as their travel history over the previous 14 days. For
                  other international arrivals, they are required to
                  self-isolate for 14 days upon arrival. The measures apply to
                  arrival by air, rail, and ferry. Persons arriving from
                  Ireland, the Channel Islands, and the Isle of Man are exempt
                  from the restrictions. Travelers from Andorra, Austria,
                  Croatia, Czech Republic, France, Luxembourg, Malta, Monaco,
                  the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland need to self-isolate
                  for 14 days to enter the UK. Effective July 11, 2020,
                  authorities in England will lift quarantine requirements for
                  arrivals from more than 50 countries. All international
                  arrivals to the UK must provide contact details, as well as
                  their travel history over the previous 14 days. International
                  arrivals of any nationality arriving from nonexemptnon-exempt
                  locations are required to self-isolate for 14 days, health

                  The European Council has issued a revised list of countries
                  for which Schengen member states should relax entry
                  restrictions as of August 1, 2020. The European Council's
                  recommendation is advisory only, individual member states
                  retain the authority to unilaterally deny travel from
                  countries on the approved list or to permit travel with
                  countries not on the approved list. The approved country list
                  for travel includes Australia, Canada, Georgia, Japan,
                  Morocco, New Zealand, Rwanda, South Korea, Thailand, Tunisia
                  and Uruguay. EU citizens and their family members, and people
                  with Swedish residence permits, are allowed to enter Sweden
                  without restrictions; also citizens from Norway, Iceland,
                  Switzerland, Liechtenstein, and UK. Also, travelers coming
                  from Australia, Georgia, Japan, Canada, New Zealand, Rwanda,
                  South Korea, Thailand, Tunisia, and Uruguay can enter Sweden.
                  Exceptions to the ban will also be made for students as of
                  July 4, 2020. For travelers from other countries Sweden has
                  imposed a temporary entry ban to non-essential travels to
                  Sweden in effect until October 31, 2020.

                  The European Council has issued a revised list of countries
                  for which Schengen member states should relax entry
                  restrictions as of August 1, 2020. The European Council's
                  recommendation is advisory only, individual member states
                  retain the authority to unilaterally deny travel from
                  countries on the approved list or to permit travel with
                  countries not on the approved list. The approved country list
                  for travel includes Australia, Canada, Georgia, Japan,
                  Morocco, New Zealand, Rwanda, South Korea, Thailand, Tunisia
                  and Uruguay. Traveling to and from EU countries (except for
                  Bulgaria, Luxembourg, Portugal, Romania and Sweden), Norway,
                  Switzerland, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and UK is allowed without
                  restriction. Also, travelers coming from Australia, China
                  (PRC), Japan, New Zealand and South Korea can enter Slovakia
                  without any restriction. Citizens of EU Member States and
                  their family members are allowed to transit Slovakia for
                  purpose of returning to their EU Member State. Such transit
                  requires an uninterrupted passing of the territory (refueling
                  is allowed) within eight hours maximum. Entry restrictions
                  apply to most other foreign nationals.

                  the Netherlands from third countries, until June 30, 2020.
                  Effective August 12, 2020: long-term residents of the
                  following countries are allowed to travel to the Netherlands:
                  Australia, Canada, Georgia, Japan, New Zealand, Rwanda, South
                  Korea, Thailand, Tunisia, Uruguay and China. This applies
                  explicitly to residents not nationals. Travel is allowed for
                  citizens from EU and EEA countries. Countries are divided in
                  areas, depending on their epidemiological situation. Travelers
                  from countries classified as "green" or "yellow" can enter the

                  Travelers from EU and Schengen countries can travel in and out
                  of The Netherlands. Dutch advice and rules to combat the
                  spread of COVID-19 must be followed. Travelers from high-risk
                  areas are strongly urged to go into quarantine for 10 days
                  (e.g. Sweden and the United Kingdom). All passengers traveling
                  to the Netherlands from an airport in a high risk area must
                  complete a health declaration form. The form contains
                  questions related to the presence of symptoms which could be
                  related to the COVID-19 virus. Before boarding a plane the
                  crew checks the completed health declaration form. In case you
                  have one of the symptoms as listed in the health declaration
                  form, you will not be accepted on the flight to the
                  Netherlands. This is also applicable for transit passengers.
                  The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) maintains a
                  list of airports in areas with a high risk of contamination.
                  Please verify with your airport of destination if additional
                  requirements apply there. You can find measures at Schiphol

                  Travelers to or from the Netherlands, in particular Dutch
                  nationals or long-term residents, should check the latest
                  information on travel advice (with particular reference to
                  green, yellow, orange, and red travel advisory zones at:
                  www.government.nl and www.netherlandsworldwide.nl Traveling to
                  countries or zones with an orange or red travel advisory is
                  discouraged because of the risks. If you go to one of these
                  countries, you are strongly advised to go into self-quarantine
                  at home for 10 days immediately after returning to the
                  Netherlands. It does not matter whether a country already had
                  an orange travel advisory when you arrived there or this
                  changed during your stay. In both cases you must
                  self-quarantine for 10 ​days after arriving in the
                  Netherlands. This also applies if you return home immediately
                  if an advisory changes to orange. Traveling to the Caribbean

                  recommendation is advisory only, individual member states
                  retain the authority to unilaterally deny travel from

                  The European Council has issued a revised list of countries
                  for which Schengen member states should relax entry
                  restrictions as of August 1, 2020. The European Council's
                  recommendation is advisory only, individual member states
                  retain the authority to unilaterally deny travel from
                  countries on the approved list or to permit travel with
                  countries not on the approved list. The approved country list
                  for travel includes Australia, Canada, Georgia, Japan,
                  Morocco, New Zealand, Rwanda, South Korea, Thailand, Tunisia
                  and Uruguay. Andorra, Belgium, Luxembourg, Malta, Monaco,
                  Romania, and Spain (Canary Islands excluded) are defined as
                  COVID-19 risk areas since August 26, 2020. A regularly updated
                  list of countries with increased COVID-19 riks is available

                  (e.g., healthcare professionals) and for priority cases for
                  family members of citizens, legal residents, and EU citizens
                  in Ireland. The EU Council recommended lifting of the travel
                  ban for 15 non-European countries from July 1, 2020: Algeria,
                  Australia, Canada, Georgia, Japan, Montenegro, Morocco, New
                  Zealand, Rwanda, Serbia, South Korea, Thailand, Tunisia,
                  Uruguay, and China, if they open their borders for EU
                  travelers. The recommendation is not binding for the member
                  states. This isn’t decided or published from the Irish
                  government yet. The nation's new "Travel Green List," which

                  The European Council has issued a revised list of countries
                  for which Schengen member states should relax entry
                  restrictions as of August 1. The European Council's
                  recommendation is advisory only, individual member states
                  retain the authority to unilaterally deny travel from
                  countries on the approved list or to permit travel with
                  countries not on the approved list. As of August 19, 2020 all
                  countries and territories in the world have been qualified as
                  risk areas. No traveler from EU member states, Norway,
                  Switzerland, or Liechtenstein is allowed to enter to or exit
                  from Iceland for touristic purposes. Iceland ctizens and
                  residents arriving from areas qualified as risky need to
                  undergo special precautions in the first five days upon their
                  arrival in Iceland in case they choose to get tested for
                  COVID-19. These special precautions apply until they can get
                  tested for the second time. Once passengers from high-risk
                  areas arrive in Iceland, they have the option to get tested
                  for COVID-19 or to undergo a quarantine for two weeks.
                  Passengers born in 2005 or afterwards and such passengers
                  arriving from other areas than "high risk" areas are not
                  required to get tested and to undergo a quarantine. Third
                  country nationals arriving from outside the EU, Norway,
                  Switzerland, and Liechtenstein can only enter Iceland for
                  essential reasons or if they have a permanent residency in
                  Iceland or within the EU/Schengen Area. Travel restrictions
                  have been lifted for cetain residents of 12
                  non-EU/non-Schengen Area states, e.g. Australia, Canada,
                  Georgia, Japan, Morocco, New Zealand, Rwanda, South Korea,
                  Thailand, Tunisia, and Uruguay.

                  The European Council has issued a revised list of countries
                  for which Schengen member states should relax entry
                  restrictions as of August 1. The European Council's
                  recommendation is advisory only, individual member states
                  retain the authority to unilaterally deny travel from
                  countries on the approved list or to permit travel with
                  countries not on the approved list. The approved country list
                  for travel includes Australia, Canada, Georgia, Japan, New
                  Zealand, Rwanda, South Korea, Thailand, Tunisia and Uruguay.
                  Applies to travelers on non-essential travel from a third
                  country into the EU+ area (all EU member states plus Iceland,
                  Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland), except certain
                  third-country nationals with long-term residency rights.
                  Travelers from the EU, Schengen Area, the United Kingdom, and
                  Ireland may enter the country provided they neither show signs
                  of illness nor have been ill within the past 14 days.
                  Travelers from a country with more than 25 infected
                  inhabitants per 100,000 inhabitants are denied entry to the
                  country. Citizens and residents from Estonia, Latvia, and
                  Lithuania can travel between them without restriction. Most
                  foreign nationals from outside the EU, UK, and Schengen Area
                  are still barred from entry. Allows entry for citizens of all
                  countries in the EU, the Schengen area, the United Kingdom,
                  Northern Ireland, Andorra, Monaco, San Marina, Vatican City,

                  The European Council has issued a revised list of countries
                  for which Schengen member states should relax entry
                  restrictions as of August 1. The European Council's
                  recommendation is advisory only, individual member states
                  retain the authority to unilaterally deny travel from
                  countries on the approved list or to permit travel with
                  countries not on the approved list. The approved country list
                  for travel includes Australia, Canada, Georgia, Japan,
                  Morocco, New Zealand, Rwanda, South Korea, Thailand, Tunisia
                  and Uruguay. Applies to travelers on non-essential travel from
                  a third country into the EU+ area (all EU member states plus
                  Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland). Among others,
                  the following are exempt: nationals of all EU Member States
                  plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland, and certain
                  third-country nationals with long-term residency rights.
                  Effective March 16, 2020, applies to all travelers except for
                  EU citizens or third country nationals working or studying in
                  Cyprus. Airports and ports reopen as of June 9, 2020. Flights
                  are restored with three categories of countries: Category A:
                  Canada, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, Georgia, Germany, Hungary,
                  South Korea, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, New Zealand,
                  Norway, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Thailand. Category B: Austria,
                  Belgium, China (PRC), Czech Republic, Denmark, Greece, Vatican
                  City, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Monaco, Poland,
                  Portugal, Rwanda, San Marino, Sweden, Switzerland, the United
                  Kingdom, and Uruguay. Category C: any country not listed in
                  category A or B. Travelers from countries not included within
                  these categories remain barred from entry.

                  Tourist travel will be permitted to resume from July 1, 2020,
                  when arrivals from countries with high COVID-19 activity will
                  be required to undergo medical screening and quarantine. The
                  EU Council recommended lifting of the travel ban for 15
                  non-European countries from July 1, 2020: Algeria, Australia,
                  Canada, Georgia, Japan, Montenegro, Morocco, New Zealand,
                  Rwanda, Serbia, South Korea, Thailand, Tunisia, Uruguay, and
                  China, if they open their borders for EU travelers. The
                  recommendation is not binding for the member states. This
                  isn’t decided or published from the Cypriot government yet.
                  All passengers traveling to Cyprus (either by direct flight or
                  with transit stops) shall submit all information and documents
                  required to obtain the “Cyprus Flight Pass” within 24 hours
                  before departure from their home country to Cyprus.

                  On July 15, 2020, Norway has lifted its entry restrictions
                  (that were introduced on March 16, 2020) for travelers coming
                  from Schengen and EEA countries, provided that the country of
                  origin meets the epidemiological criteria defined by the
                  Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH). If travelers
                  arrive from a country or an area without sufficiently low
                  transmission, they must go into quarantine for 10 days from
                  the day they arrive in Norway. Applies to travelers on
                  non-essential travel from a third country into the EU+ area
                  (all EU member states plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway,
                  Switzerland). Among others, the following are exempt:
                  nationals of all EU Member States plus Iceland, Liechtenstein,
                  Norway, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and certain
                  third-country nationals with long-term residency rights.
                  Applies to all travelers who do not reside or work in Norway;
                  effective March 15, 2020, the borders of Norway are closed.
                  Does not apply to EEA citizens and their family members. This
                  does not apply to passengers in transit. As of July 1, 2020,
                  foreign nationals who hold a work permit will be allowed to
                  enter the country. As of June 28, 2020, airports are open and
                  flights continue operating, although international flight
                  options are reduced. Most travelers from all other countries
                  not on the list are currently prohibited from entry as of July
                  20, 2020, excluding those with close family in Norway and
                  individuals who have been granted permits to work or study in
                  Norway. Travel permit for non EU/EEA travelers.

                  for 10 days from the day they arrive in Norway. This is done
                  with a map in the traffic light system. In red areas there is
                  a mandatory 10 days quarantine, in orange/yellow cases
                  quarantining is only highly recommended. Currently, no
                  countries are marked as green.

                  The European Council has issued a revised list of countries
                  for which Schengen member states should relax entry
                  restrictions as of August 1. The European Council's
                  recommendation is advisory only, individual member states
                  retain the authority to unilaterally deny travel from
                  countries on the approved list or to permit travel with
                  countries not on the approved list. The approved country list
                  for travel includes Australia, Canada, Georgia, Japan,
                  Morocco, New Zealand, Rwanda, South Korea, Thailand, Tunisia
                  and Uruguay. A ban on entry to the territory of the Czech
                  Republic for all foreigners except for foreigners with
                  permanent or temporary (over 90 day-long) residency in the
                  Czech Republic, nationals and family members of all EU Member
                  States plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland, the
                  United Kingdom, and certain third-country nationals with
                  long-term residence rights in the EU+ countries and other
                  authorized persons. Family members must present marriage
                  certificate or birth certificates. Effective May 26, 2020,
                  border crossings with Austria and Germany are open and
                  authorities will only conduct spot checks on travelers, though
                  if stopped travelers must still produce a negative COVID-19
                  test or agree to be quarantined for 14 days. Effective May 27,
                  2020, citizens of the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia
                  may travel freely between these three countries without
                  restriction provided they return to their home country within
                  48 hours. Effective April 27, 2020, EU citizens are permitted
                  to enter the country for business or study purposes, provided
                  they produce evidence that they do not have COVID-19 or agree
                  to be quarantined for 14 days. Effective June 11, 2020 the
                  temporary restrictions on third-country nationals (not EU/EEA)
                  have been prolonged until the end of June. Restrictions have
                  been reimposed with Montenegro and Serbia as of July 13, 2020.
                  Traveling to and from EU countries is allowed without
                  restrictions, except for Romania and Spain as of August 24,
                  2020. Citizens of Norway, Switzerland, Iceland, Liechtenstein,
                  Andorra, Monaco, Vatican City, and San Marino are allowed to
                  enter the Czech Republic without restrictions. The following
                  third countries are considered to be low at risk of infection:
                  Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Canada, South Korea, Thailand,
                  and Tunisia. Countries are divided in two categories: green
                  and red. Citizens from green countries are allowed to enter
                  without restrictions. Citizens from red EU-countries have to
                  provide a negative COVID-19 test result or agree to be
                  quarantined for 14 days. Citizens from red non-EU countries
                  shall only travel to the Czech Republic for the reasons
                  specified in the protective measure and are subject to
                  presentation of a negative COVID-19 test result or agree to be
                  quarantined.

                  COVID-19 free or must self-isolate for 14-days. The green-list
                  currently includes the following countries: Andorra,

                  allowed only to exempted categories and negative PCR test will
                  have to be submitted on entry. A list of such countries based

                  on a weekly basis. EU citizens entering for the purpose of
                  economic activity for a period exceeding 72 hours have to
                  submit a medical certificate. Third-country citizens have to
                  submit a medical certificate supplemented by a negative test.
                  The EU Council recommended lifting of the travel ban for 15
                  non-European countries from July 1, 2020: Algeria, Australia,
                  Canada, Georgia, Japan, Montenegro, Morocco, New Zealand,
                  Rwanda, Serbia, South Korea, Thailand, Tunisia, Uruguay, and
                  China, if they open their borders for EU travelers. The
                  recommendation is not binding for the member states. This
                  isn’t decided or published from the Czech government yet. As
                  of August 3, 2020, the COVID-19 epidemiological situation of
                  the following regions in individual countries are considered
                  to be risky: Austria - Upper Austria, Vienna; Bulgaria -
                  Sofia, Varna, Plovdiv; Croatia - Vukovarsko, Zagreb, Osječko,
                  Split – Dalmatia; Portugal - Lisbon; Spain - Cataluna, Aragón,
                  Navarra, País Vasco; Sweden - Västerbotten, Västra Götaland,
                  Gävleborg; and Switzerland - Genf. As of August 27, 2020, the
                  following non-EU countries are considered to be safe:
                  Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Thailand, Tunisia, South Korea
                  and Japan.

                  Travelers to the UAE must first receive approval from the
                  Federal Authority for Identity and Citizenship through the
                  Twajudi Resident Service. Etihad Airways (EY) is operating
                  repatriation flights through at least June 15, 2020. As of
                  August 12, 2020, residents of the UAE no longer require
                  approval from the Federal Authority for Identity and
                  Citizenship (ICA) to return to the country. The ICA will
                  automatically grant pre-approval for expatriate residents
                  wishing to return without the need to apply for an entry
                  permit. Residents are advised to provide their passport
                  number, Emirates ID number, and personal data. In the past,
                  regulations announced regarding the UAE have not always been
                  applied to Dubai Emirate. Authorities have yet to clarify if
                  this is the case. Residents who hold Dubai-issued visas are
                  permitted to enter on any airline on the condition that they
                  obtain prior approval from the General Directorate of
                  Residency and Foreign Affairs and the airline. Residents who
                  hold Dubai-issued visas are permitted to return to the emirate
                  on any airline on the condition that they obtain prior
                  approval from the General Directorate of Residency and Foreign
                  Affairs and the airline. Effective May 21, 2020, Emirates
                  Airlines (EK) announced they would operate multiple regular,
                  non-repatriation flights to several locations in Europe, the
                  United States, Canada, and Australia through at least June 30,
                  2020. An indefinite prohibition on entry by Gulf Cooperation
                  Council (GCC) nationals is in place. As of June 23, 2020,
                  there are no restrictions on overseas destinations to which
                  citizens and residents of Dubai can travel. All inbound
                  passengers will undergo another COVID-19 test upon arrival to
                  Abu Dhabi. Abu Dhabi residents are allowed to take 48-hour
                  trips to other emirates. Residents must be tested in Abu Dhabi
                  before leaving. Authorities will check results upon returning
                  to Abu Dhabi. If traveling outside of Abu Dhabi for longer
                  than 48 hours, residents will have to take a new test. Anyone
                  wishing to leave the UAE must first obtain a permit from the
                  Federal Authority for Identity and Citizenship (ICA).
                  Travelers are required to present a negative COVID-19 test
                  obtained within the previous 48 hours prior to boarding a
                  flight as well as fill in a health declaration form. Approval
                  to leave the UAE will be granted based on the perceived level
                  of risk in the destination country and the purpose of the
                  journey.

                  Officials are enforcing enhanced health screenings and
                  requirements for all arriving passengers. Stricter
                  requirements are being enforced for travelers from US states
                  with a high incidence of COVID-19 cases. Travelers from these
                  states have to provide proof of a negative COVID-19 test prior
                  to traveling to Aruba via the digital
                  Embarkation-Disembarkation Card (ED card), they will not be
                  able to use testing facilities at the airport upon arrival.
                  These states are: • Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California,
                  Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana,
                  Mississippi, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon,
                  South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah,
                  Wisconsin, and Wyoming. Travelers from the remaining states
                  and permitted countries are not required to submit proof of a
                  valid negative COVID-19 test prior to arrival, however, if
                  they choose not to do a test prior to travel they will be
                  subject to obligatory testing at the airport at the travelers’
                  expense. The traveler will then be subject to a mandatory
                  24-hour quarantine at the traveler’s accommodation while
                  awaiting test results. Passengers who decline to take the test
                  and those who test positive for COVID-19 will be quarantined
                  at an approved location.

                  The European Council has issued a revised list of countries
                  for which Schengen member states should relax entry
                  restrictions as of August 1. The European Council's
                  recommendation is advisory only, individual member states
                  retain the authority to unilaterally deny travel from
                  countries on the approved list or to permit travel with
                  countries not on the approved list. The approved country list
                  for travel includes Australia, Canada, Georgia, Japan,
                  Morocco, New Zealand, Rwanda, South Korea, Thailand, Tunisia
                  and Uruguay. Effective June 15, 2020, borders will be reopened

                  shuttle bus from Hong Kong International Airport immediately
                  to the temporary specimen collection center at AsiaWorld-Expo
                  (AWE) to collect deep throat saliva samples in accordance with
                  the instructions and submit the samples to the Department of
                  Health personnel at the venue for conducting COVID-19 test.
                  They are also mandated to wait for test results at a
                  designated location. Effective 25 July 2020, passengers who
                  have been in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan,
                  Philippines or South Africa in the past 14 days must have a
                  medical certificate with a negative Coronavirus (COVID-19)
                  test result issued at most 72 hours before departure. The
                  certificate must be in Chinese or English. The same measure
                  applies to travelers from Kazakhstan and the US as from July
                  29, 2020. All arrivals from these high-risk countries will be

                  COVID-19 test result within 48 hours of departure for Hong
                  Kong.

                  measure does not apply to office spaces. Residents also must
                  wear face coverings on all forms of public transport.
                  Effective July 29, 2020, quarantine measures for sea and
                  aircrews will be tighten indefinitely. Ships without cargo
                  cannot exchange crews. On other ships, workers are no longer
                  allowed to enter the territory and must travel directly to the
                  airport after disembarking if completing their service
                  onboard. Airlines and shipping companies must arrange
                  point-to-point transport for employees to limit interaction

                  Travelers from low-risk nations are given rapid COVID-19 tests
                  upon arrival and will be granted unrestricted movement. Those
                  from medium-risk will be granted the rapid COVID-19 test but
                  only granted limited movement. Those from high-risk nations
                  must provide proof of negative COVID-19 test in past seven
                  days before arrival and they will be retested upon arrival and
                  required to quarantine themselves until the results prove
                  negative. If travelers from any country test positive in the
                  PCR tests, they will be required to quarantine in a state
                  facility for 14 days. All travelers must fill a health form
                  and download Grenada's COVID-19 contact-tracing app prior to

                  The European Council has issued a revised list of countries
                  for which Schengen member states should relax entry
                  restrictions as of August 1, 2020. The European Council's
                  recommendation is advisory only, individual member states
                  retain the authority to unilaterally deny travel from
                  countries on the approved list or to permit travel with
                  countries not on the approved list. Entry from a country with
                  a stable COVID-19 situation is possible without restrictions.
                  The corresponding countries are as at August 20, 2020:
                  Andorra, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Finland, France,
                  Greece, Ireland, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein,

                  The European Council has issued a revised list of countries
                  for which Schengen member states should relax entry
                  restrictions as of August 1. The European Council's
                  recommendation is advisory only, individual member states
                  retain the authority to unilaterally deny travel from
                  countries on the approved list or to permit travel with
                  countries not on the approved list. The approved country list
                  for travel includes Australia, Canada, Georgia, Japan,
                  Morocco, New Zealand, Rwanda, South Korea, Thailand, Tunisia
                  and Uruguay. Applies to travelers on non-essential travel from
                  a third country into the EU+ area (all EU member states plus
                  Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland). Among others,
                  the following are exempt: nationals of all EU Member States
                  plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland, certain
                  third-country nationals with long-term residency rights, and
                  travelers in transit to their home countries. EU residents and
                  citizens of neighboring countries may now enter without having
                  to prove the nature of their visit. Citizens of the Czech
                  Republic, Hungary, Austria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania,
                  Poland, Slovenia, Germany, and Slovakia may enter the country
                  without having to prove business or touristic purposes. Other
                  EU citizens may now enter the country for business and
                  touristic purposes. All EU and EEA nationals, third-country
                  nationals who are long-term residents under the Council
                  Directive 2003/109/EC, persons entitled to reside under other

                  visas, and citizens of Andorra, the Republic of San Marino,
                  Monaco and the Holy See, can enter Croatia under the same

                  nationals who want to enter Croatia for tourism have to
                  present a confirmation of paid accomodation.

                  quarantine is mandatory, which may be shortened. Third country
                  nationals are not subject to a 14-day self-isolation if they
                  present a negative COVID-19 test not older than 48 hours at
                  the border crossing point. If third country nationals have a
                  test older than 48 hours, they will be obliged to self-isolate
                  and re-test themselves in Croatia at their own expenses
                  otherwise 14-days self-quarantine is mandatory. All travelers
                  shall fill out the form available at the ENTERCROATIA webpage.

                  remains the only airport open for international flights. The
                  EU Council recommended lifting of the travel ban for 15
                  non-European countries from July 1, 2020: Algeria, Australia,
                  Canada, Georgia, Japan, Montenegro, Morocco, New Zealand,
                  Rwanda, Serbia, South Korea, Thailand, Tunisia, Uruguay, and

                  Starting from April 8 until April 22, 2020, passengers of
                  Chinese nationality taking a scheduled flight to China from 26
                  countries: Italy, United States, Spain, Germany, Iran, France,

                  Malaysia, Denmark, Canada, Israel, Czech, Ireland, Philippine
                  and Thailand should make daily report on personal information,
                  health status and travel history through an APP in WeChat
                  International version. After April 22, 2020, passengers should
                  make daily report 14 days before the date of boarding. Russia
                  has been added to this list since April 15, 2020. All
                  international flights to Beijing are currently being
                  redirected to 12 other cities. Once those with symptoms or
                  identified as or suspicious of carrying the virus have been
                  identified, other passengers will then be able to travel to
                  Beijing, although significant delay can be expected. Once
                  those identified passengers complete the 14-day mandatory
                  quarantine in these other cities and get a negative test
                  result, if they travel to Beijing on the same or following
                  day, they will not be subject to further quarantine in
                  Beijing. Otherwise, another 14-day mandatory quarantine will
                  be required upon arrival in Beijing. Almost all arriving
                  travelers from overseas will be subject to 14-day quarantine
                  requirement with exceptions in certain regions where longer
                  quarantine period is required. All inbound travelers to
                  Shenzhen shall be subject to 14-day mandatory quarantine at
                  government designated facilities. All inbound travelers
                  arriving in Shanghai from any country will be subject to
                  14-day mandatory quarantine and nucleic acid test . Additional
                  domestic rules may apply to multi-city travel (e.g., overseas
                  arrival in Shanghai then onward transit to Beijing). "Fast
                  track" entry is allowed for business travelers from South
                  Korea to 10 Chinese locations, including Shanghai and
                  Liaoning, Shandong, Jiangsu, and Anhui provinces, where such
                  travelers will be subject to one- or two-days quarantine
                  instead of a normal 14-day quarantine. Passengers must have an
                  invitation from a Chinese business. Approved travelers from
                  South Korea will have to undergo testing in South Korea within
                  72 hours of travel and undergo testing again during a one or
                  two-day quarantine in China (PRC). “Fast track” entry is
                  allowed for business travelers from Singapore to Guangdong,
                  Jiangsu, and Zhejiang provinces and Chongqing, Shanghai.
                  Travelers must receive a special pass from an inviting
                  institution, test negative for COVID-19 within 48 hours of
                  their departure, and obtain a visa. Passengers will undergo
                  COVID-19 testing again upon arrival in China and isolate at
                  designated facilities until their results are available.
                  Travelers must receive a negative COVID-19 test result within
                  seven days of their departure from Beijing for essential
                  trips. Residents of low-risk sub-districts in Beijing are also
                  free to travel to and from the capital without proof of a
                  negative COVID-19 test. Macau residents must complete a
                  nucleic acid test, convert to a Guangdong health code, and
                  complete a health declaration form before entering Guangdong.
                  Guangdong authorities require a negative COVID-19 test result
                  and a one-day quarantine for travelers from Hong Kong, unless
                  exempted. Passengers arriving from Bangladesh, Chad, Egypt,

                  On August 12, 2020, Chinese authorities announced that
                  nationals of 36 European countries can reapply for Chinese
                  visas if they are already in possession of a valid Chinese
                  residence permit. Authorities are issuing new visas for South
                  Koreans who have valid Chinese residence permits, Z (work)
                  visas, or who plan to study in China. Specially designated
                  foreign workers with invitation letters issued by provincial
                  or municipal government officials in China are being allowed
                  to apply for visas and authorized to reenter the country.
                  Effective April 8, 2020, Wuhan Tianhe International Airport
                  will resume operation except flights to and from Beijing.
                  Travelers arriving in Beijing from high-risk areas in China
                  (PRC) will be subject to 14-day quarantine, while no
                  quarantine requirement for travelers from low-risk areas if
                  they can provide a green QR code. Employers are still required
                  to report to the landlord or local neighborhood council about
                  any employees arriving from overseas and high-risk areas in
                  China (PRC). Effective, June 16, 2020, controls and transport
                  restrictions in Beijing have been expanded. Districts such as
                  Fengtai, Chaoyang, Daxing, and Mentougou are placed under “war
                  time” restrictions. In most other cities, domestic arrival
                  will not be subject to mandatory quarantine if they can
                  provide a green QR code. Beginning June 8, 2020, essential
                  business travel from Singapore under a fast-track arrangement
                  is allowed. The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC)
                  is allowing more international commercial flights to operate.
                  CAAC will limit total international flights. Business
                  travelers testing negative will adhere to a pre-agreed
                  itinerary and refrain from using public transport, except for
                  private hire vehicles, for the first 14 days. The travelers
                  will have to download and use a health pass while in the
                  country.

                  The European Council has issued a revised list of countries
                  for which Schengen member states should relax entry
                  restrictions as of August 1, 2020. The European Council's
                  recommendation is advisory only, individual member states
                  retain the authority to unilaterally deny travel from
                  countries on the approved list or to permit travel with
                  countries not on the approved list. The approved country list
                  for travel includes (inter alia) Australia, Canada, Georgia,
                  Japan, Morocco, New Zealand, Rwanda, South Korea, Thailand,
                  Tunisia, and Uruguay. As of September 1, 2020, no foreigner
                  (including the EU, Liechtenstein, Iceland, Norway, and
                  Switzerland) is allowed to enter Hungary without a special
                  reason. Others rules may apply with respect to business or
                  diplomatic travels.

                  Travelers who have been in high-risk countries are required to
                  bring negative COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test
                  results with them to present upon arrival, or to take a test
                  and remain at the airport or a government facility until the
                  results are available. Persons with negative tests are
                  required to undergo 14 days of quarantine, with the option of
                  taking a second COVID-19 test 5-7 days after the first test.
                  Persons will typically be released from quarantine once the
                  second test result comes back negative. Travelers who have
                  been in medium-risk countries will be allowed to leave the
                  airport immediately if they present negative results to a
                  COVID-19 PCR test. These persons will be subject to daily
                  health monitoring for a period of 14 days. Persons who elect
                  to take a second test 5-7 days after arrival and test
                  negative, will not be subject to further monitoring. Travelers
                  who have been in low-risk countries are required to either
                  bring negative results of a COVID-19 PCR test or take a test
                  upon arrival. Such persons will be allowed to leave the
                  airport upon validation of negative results. All travelers
                  must complete and submit a customs form with health screening
                  questions at least 24 hours prior to their arrival. Masks must
                  be worn at all times while at the airport.

                  All scheduled international commercial passenger services will
                  remain closed until September 30, 2020. Until then, no
                  international aircraft will be allowed to disembark passengers
                  (including citizens) in India, with the following exception.
                  From May 7, 2020, the Indian government has been evacuating
                  stranded Indian citizens in a phased manner from several
                  countries on special flights. On May 22, 2020, the Government
                  of India announced that the following categories of Overseas
                  Citizens of India (OCI) cardholders may travel to India on
                  special evacuation flights. (1) Minor children who are born to
                  Indian nationals abroad and who hold valid OCI cards; (2) OCI
                  cardholders who wish to come to India on account of family
                  emergencies; (3) University students who are OCI cardholders
                  (not minors) and whose parents are Indian citizens living in
                  India; and (4) Couples where one spouse is an OCI cardholder
                  and the other is an Indian national and who permanently reside
                  in India. The Indian government is permitting entry of foreign
                  nationals with a fresh or renewed business visa as of June 15,
                  2020. Authorized travelers include those with the managerial
                  and technical expertise required by a foreign entity located
                  in India or an Indian entity providing a letter of invitation,
                  others include Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) cardholders and
                  foreign nationals related to OCI cardholders or Indian
                  citizens. Family members of those in India with diplomatic,
                  official, or UN/international organizations visas are also
                  permitted to enter India. Such travelers must approach Indian
                  consulates for fresh visas regardless of previous visa status
                  and may enter the country via non-scheduled flights due to an
                  ongoing ban on commercial international passenger flights
                  through June 30, 2020. Anyone who qualifies for an evacuation
                  flight must register with the Indian consular post in their
                  jurisdiction and only travel to India on the designated
                  flight. While there is no specific announcement regarding
                  departure of flights from India, they are virtually at a
                  standstill. Indian officials are maintaining a ban on
                  travelers from Afghanistan, the EU, the European Free Trade
                  Association, Malaysia, Philippines, Turkey, and the United
                  Kingdom. The government has announced limited operations of
                  international commercial flights with France, Germany, Qatar,
                  Maldives, UAE, UK and the US from September 1, 2020. Entry
                  will be limited to: Indian citizens; Overseas Citizens of
                  India (OCI); cardholders and their relatives; business
                  travelers other than those with B-3 sporting visas; holders of
                  diplomatic, official, or UN/international organization visas
                  and their family members. Similar measures may be implemented
                  with Germany and the UK in the near future.

                  tracing purposes.

                  foreign national in India must make an online application on
                  the e-FRRO portal. Foreign nationals whose visas have expired
                  and who have made an application to exit the country, will be
                  granted an Exit Permit without being subject to any penalty
                  for overstay. Visa-on-arrival suspended for nationals of Japan
                  and South Korea. Travelers (once international flights are
                  permitted to land) who arrive from or have been in Italy or
                  South Korea with a visa issued after March 5, 2020 by India
                  will only be allowed to enter if they have a health
                  certificate of being tested negative for Coronavirus
                  (COVID-19) from a designated laboratory authorized by the
                  health authorities of Italy or South Korea. The use of masks

                  and the US are allowed through to at least August 1, 2020. The
                  suspension of international cruises, passenger buses, and
                  train services continues. The nightly 22:00-05:00 curfew will
                  be lifted as at August 1, 2020, however, regional variations
                  are almost certain to continue. Several areas in north India
                  have extended nightly and weekend curfews through at least
                  August 31, 2020.

                  Effective April 13, 2020, visa waiver/visa-free privileges of
                  nationals of 90 countries will be suspended; these include
                  Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, many European
                  countries, and Canada. However, the effective date of
                  suspension can vary by country because some visa exemption
                  treaties require a notice period to elapse before a suspension
                  can take effect. The government ended travel restrictions on
                  foreign nationals who visited Hubei Province, China, as at
                  August 10, 2020. Nationals of China (PRC) with a passport
                  issued in the Hubei Province are not allowed to enter South
                  Korea. Korean visas issued by the Wuhan Consulate in the Hubei
                  Province are invalidated. A visa is required to transit
                  through South Korea for nationals of China (PRC). Nationals of
                  Japan who do not hold a Korean visa issued on or after March
                  9, 2020 will not be allowed entry. Foreign travelers not
                  entering Korea are allowed to transfer without a visa unless:
                  they departed from China, they have been to Hubei in the last
                  14 days, or their passports or visa were issued in Hubei.
                  Visas for foreign nationals from Pakistan and Bangladesh have
                  been suspended.

                  Effective April 1, 2020, travelers including foreign
                  residents, short term visitors (regardless of nationality) and
                  South Korean citizens entering South Korea are subject to
                  mandatory quarantine of 2 weeks. Foreigners who arrive with a
                  non-professional employment visa are required to have
                  residences where they can self-quarantine for 14 days.
                  Passengers arriving from any country will be subject to
                  quarantine procedures. They must install a self-diagnosis
                  application in their personal device and a completed Health
                  Declaration Form and a Special Quarantine Declaration Form
                  must be presented to the quarantine desk upon arrival.
                  Effective April 2, 2020, all inbound international passengers,
                  who have suspected symptoms and intend to stay in the city,
                  are required to undergo COVID-19 tests upon arrival. Officials
                  will send arriving passengers that exhibit COVID-19 symptoms
                  to designated quarantine facilities for testing. Effective
                  April 13, 2020, travelers from the United States and Europe
                  who have no symptoms are required to undergo COVID-19 testing
                  within three days of arrival. Travelers with COVID-19 symptoms
                  will be screened immediately, while other passengers will be
                  screened at designated testing facilities in Seoul. Mandatory
                  screenings are ongoing for international arrivals at all ports
                  of entry, and testing is likely for symptomatic passengers.
                  From June 1, 2020, foreign nationals with long-term visas who
                  wish to return to South Korea after traveling abroad must
                  obtain re-entry permits before departing the country and
                  present medical screenings with proof of a negative COVID-19
                  test result before returning to South Korea. Inbound foreign
                  nationals are required to provide proof of a negative PCR
                  COVID-19 test upon entry. All arriving travelers from the
                  United States and Europe must undergo COVID-19 testing within
                  3 days of arrival. Officials will send arriving passengers
                  that exhibit COVID-19 symptoms to designated quarantine
                  facilities for testing. Passengers who have been in
                  Bangladesh, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Philippines or
                  Uzbekistan in the past 14 days must have a medical certificate
                  with a negative Coronavirus (COVID-19) PCR test result issued
                  at most 48 hours before departure. The certificate must be in
                  English. Nationals of South Korea are exempt. Merchant seamen
                  with a visa must have a medical certificate with a negative
                  Coronavirus (COVID-19) PCR test result issued at most 48 hours
                  before departure. The certificate must be in English and
                  passengers must have two copies of the certificate.

                  Effective June 23, 2020, South Korean authorities will limit
                  visa and entry restrictions for passengers traveling from six
                  countries, including Bangladesh, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and
                  Pakistan. This does not apply to diplomatic travelers and
                  people traveling for urgent business reasons. Effective June
                  1, 2020, ARC holders (with limited exemptions) must obtain
                  re-entry permission before departing South Korea. ARC holders
                  (with limited exemptions) returning to South Korea must obtain
                  a medical diagnosis/clearance in English within 48 hours of
                  boarding the return flight. Effective April 13, 2020,
                  short-term consular visas issued on or before April 5, 2020
                  will be invalidated; this does not apply to C-4 short-term
                  employment visas or long-term work visas. ARCs of foreign
                  residents (with some exception) are automatically extended for
                  three months from the current expiry date, so long as the
                  holder is in South Korea as of April 9, 2020 and the ARC
                  expiry date falls between April 9 and May 31, 2020 (both dates
                  inclusive). Visas issued to nationals of Japan (at Korean
                  Diplomatic Missions in Japan) before March 9, 2020 are
                  invalidated. This does not apply to visas issued outside
                  Japan. Such visas remain valid. Visa-free entry to Jeju Island
                  is temporarily suspended to all foreign nationals. Visa-free
                  and visa-waiver programs have been halted with countries that
                  have entry bans for South Korean citizens. The restriction
                  impacts travelers from 90 countries, including Australia,
                  Canada, and most European nations.

                  By Presidential Proclamation, effective April 23, 2020,
                  issuance of immigrant visas (for US permanent residency) to
                  individuals outside the United States paused for 60 days. The
                  US State Department has raised its travel alert for US
                  citizens to Level 4 (Do Not Travel), the highest advisory
                  level. All US embassies and consulates have temporarily
                  suspended routine visa services and will cancel all routine
                  immigrant and nonimmigrant visa appointments as of March 20,
                  2020. As resources allow, embassies and consulates will
                  continue to provide emergency and mission critical visa
                  services. Travelers who have visited China (PRC), Iran,

                  states. This isn’t decided or published from the Romania
                  government yet. Beginning September 1, 2020, Romanian

                  Moscow Oblast since March 30, 2020. Entry and exit into Moscow
                  are permitted, but movement within the city will require
                  special permits. Effective March 30, 2020, suspended entry

                  Polish authorities will ease additional restrictions from June
                  6, 2020. International passenger flights to EU destinations
                  have resumed as of June 16, 2020. Work permits and statements
                  about entrusting work to foreigner (Special Permissions),
                  national visas and residence cards that expire during epidemic
                  will be automatically prolonged until 30 days after end of
                  epidemic state. Foreigners other than Polish national visa
                  holders and Polish residence permit holders will be allowed to
                  continue their stay in Poland past expiry of their right of
                  stay. This is applicable to: (1) Holders of Schengen visas;
                  (2) Holders of Residence Permits or long term visas issued by
                  another Schengen country; and (3) Foreigners staying in Poland
                  based on visa free movement. These foreigners will have their
                  right to stay in Poland extended until 30 days after
                  cancellation of the epidemic state, provided that they were
                  already staying in Poland on March 14, 2020. Eligible seasonal
                  workers are exempt from work permit requirement until 30 days
                  after end of epidemic state, provided that they already held a
                  proper work authorization document after March 13, 2020. The
                  EU Council recommended lifting of the travel ban for 15
                  non-European countries from July 1, 2020: Algeria, Australia,
                  Canada, Georgia, Japan, Montenegro, Morocco, New Zealand,
                  Rwanda, Serbia, South Korea, Thailand, Tunisia, Uruguay, and
                  China, if they open their borders for EU travelers. The
                  recommendation is not binding for the member states. This
                  isn’t decided or published from the Bulgarian government yet.

                  Extending enhanced community quarantine in high-risk areas,
                  including Metro Manila, through September 30, 2020.
                  Authorities imposed a 22:00 -05:00 nightly curfew in Metro
                  Manila through at least August 31, 2020. All visas, including
                  previously issued documents and visa-free privileges remain
                  suspended. The central government has lifted a ban on
                  nonessential outbound travel. People traveling overseas will
                  have to comply with health protocols, including having travel
                  health insurance that covers rebooking and accommodation
                  expenses and signing a declaration form acknowledging travel
                  risks. Authorities plan to allow long-term visa holders to
                  re-enter the Philippines from August 1, 2020. These travelers
                  will need to adhere to several protocols, including having
                  pre-booked a quarantine facility and a COVID-19 testing
                  provider in the Philippines. Other types of previously issued
                  visas and visa-free privileges are suspended. Previously
                  issued visas to foreign travelers have been cancelled. Visas
                  that have been issued to foreign spouses and children of
                  Filipino nationals, as well as foreign government and
                  international organization officials, remain valid. Inbound
                  international flights have resumed. Officials have restricted
                  incoming international commercial flights at Manila's Ninoy
                  Aquino International Airport (MNL) to Tuesdays, Wednesdays,
                  Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. Domestic flights resumed from
                  June 3, 2020. Overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) and uniformed
                  personnel on official duty can continue traveling overseas.

                  People identified as persons of interest based on screening
                  measures may be denied entry, asked to undergo a 14-day
                  self-quarantine, or may be subjected to government-imposed
                  quarantine at a designated health facility. Passengers are
                  required to provide health declarations and travel history
                  information before entering the country. As of July 23, 2020,
                  authorities require all persons entering the country to have
                  tested negative for COVID-19 within seven days prior to
                  travel. Passengers are also required to obtain written
                  approval from the National Pandemic Controller’s Office.
                  Officials have intensified health screenings for inbound
                  passengers. Staff at Jacksons International Airport (POM) and
                  other ports of entry are using thermal scanners to monitor
                  patients for possible symptoms.

                  Quarantine measures for arriving travelers are no longer
                  mandatory. Residents of French Polynesia must have a “Carte de
                  resident" with a validity of 10 years. Non-residents must have
                  an International Travel Certificate to enter and transit
                  French Polynesia. The certificate must be obtained before
                  departure via the French consular offices abroad or online at
                  https://www.interieur.gouv.fr. For international inbound
                  travelers (who will be allowed entry from July 15, 2020), they
                  will not be required to undergo quarantine, but they will have
                  to provide a polymerase chain reaction test within 72 hours of
                  traveling to French Polynesia, a medical certificate, and for
                  nonresident travelers to have international travel insurance.
                  Travelers are also required to present a receipt of health
                  registration of the Electronic Travel Information System
                  (Etis.pf). Arriving passengers are required to test themselves
                  four days after arrival, using testing kits provided to them
                  as they disembark from the plane. If they test positive they
                  will have to report to a health center.

                  All arrivals, regardless of nationality, have to undergo
                  14-day quarantine after entering Fiji. Arrivals from Australia
                  and New Zealand can provide documentation verifying that they
                  spent 14 days in quarantine in their home country, and tested
                  negative for COVID-19 within 48 hours of departing for Fiji,
                  which will allow them to avoid a strict quarantine, but still
                  remain separated from the general public.

                  submitted upon arrival and must indicate that the passenger
                  does not have any symptoms of COVID-19. Effective July 23,
                  2020, all citizens and foreigners exiting the country by air -
                  except children under the age of 10; holders of diplomatic,

                  as foreigners who have stayed in Bangladesh for less than 14
                  days - must obtain a medical certificate from a
                  government-approved facility confirming a negative coronavirus
                  disease (COVID-19) test result.

                  Only New Zealand residents, citizens (and their accompanying
                  children and partners), and selected foreign nationals are
                  permitted to enter New Zealand. This includes the Realm
                  countries (the Cook Islands, Niue, Tokelau), Australian
                  citizens and permanent residents ordinarily resident in New
                  Zealand, airline and marine crew. An entry ban for most
                  foreign nationals remains in place, however, officials lifted
                  a requirement for partners and dependents of citizens to
                  return to the country together, provided they have a visa
                  based on the relationship or usually reside in New Zealand.
                  Such travelers and diplomats posted in New Zealand can enter
                  the country without prior consent from the government.
                  Authorities permit partners, dependents, and legal guardians
                  of citizens without visas to enter the country. Entry is also
                  possible for humanitarian reasons, Australian citizens and
                  permanent residents that live in New Zealand, and Samoan and
                  Tongan citizens on essential trips approved by their
                  governments. Critical workers are permitted to travel to New
                  Zealand on short-term visas valid up to six months. Companies
                  must apply for a visa and demonstrate that the worker',s
                  technical skills are unobtainable within the country, or they
                  are working on infrastructure projects. Some long-term,
                  essential workers who meet short-term entrance criteria and
                  earn twice the median salary in the country or participate in
                  a government-backed event are allowed to enter. The government
                  requires people from these groups to receive permission before
                  traveling to the country and will review applications for
                  travel on a case-by-case basis. Transit is only allowed in
                  Auckland for maximum 24 hours.

                  ​Effective April 9, 2020, all travelers entering New Zealand
                  must remain at government designated facilities for 14 days
                  upon arrival. All inbound travelers are subject to health
                  screenings and quarantine at government-designated facilities
                  for 14 days. New Zealand has instituted a quarantine fee
                  structure for inbound travelers as at August 11, 2020. Under
                  the program, most travelers allowed into the country will have
                  to pay NZD 3,100 (USD 2,050) for the first person and NZD 950
                  (USD 628) for each additional adult and NZD 475 (USD 314) per
                  additional child. Officials do not charge for children under
                  three years of age if they are staying with another person.
                  New Zealand citizens, residence visa holders, and Australian
                  citizens and permanent residents who typically reside in New
                  Zealand, are exempt from costs, provided they departed before
                  August 11, 2020, and intend to stay in the country longer than
                  90 days upon their return. Temporary visa holders are also
                  exempt from fees if they were residents in New Zealand as at
                  March 19, 2020, and were outside the country before that date.
                  Companies can cover the quarantine costs for inbound critical
                  workers. The government has also introduced a bill in
                  Parliament that would require travelers to pay for quarantine
                  costs, with exceptions. However, it is unclear if or when the
                  regulation will take effect. Quarantined passengers must test
                  negative for COVID-19 and undergo two additional tests before
                  departing facilities. Authorities have also extended the ban
                  on cruise ships entering New Zealand ports, cargo and fishing
                  vessels will be allowed to load and unload and undertake
                  repairs. Vessel crews arriving in New Zealand are required to
                  spend 14 days in quarantine unless they had been on the vessel
                  for 28 days before docking at the port.

                  International air, road, and rail travel has resumed with
                  certain limitations. Direct passenger flights from Sweden,
                  Portugal, United Kingdom, United States, Iran, and Turkey are
                  suspended. The EU Council recommended lifting of the travel
                  ban for 15 non-European countries from July 1, 2020: Algeria,
                  Australia, Canada, Georgia, Japan, Montenegro, Morocco, New
                  Zealand, Rwanda, Serbia, South Korea, Thailand, Tunisia,
                  Uruguay, and China, if they open their borders for EU
                  travelers. The recommendation is not binding for the member
                  states. This isn’t decided or published from the Romania
                  government yet.

                  Authorities in Macau are requiring travelers from Hong Kong to
                  provide evidence of negative COVID-19 test results taken
                  within 72 hours prior to arrival as of early August​ 2020. All
                  Macao residents who have been in Schengen Area, the United
                  Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Brazil, Egypt, Australia,
                  South Korea, Japan, Iran, and New Zealand in the past 14 days
                  are subject to quarantine for 14 days. Residents and travelers
                  who visited Hong Kong, Taiwan, and other countries are allowed
                  to self-isolate at home. As of 14 June, 2020, Macau and Zhuhai
                  have eased quarantine requirements for some travel. Officials
                  are permitting Macau citizens that live in Zhuhai with
                  residency permits to cross the border without quarantine
                  requirements, after applying for an exemption. Macau teachers
                  and students residing in Zhuhai do not have to apply for the
                  exemption. Travelers must receive approval from health
                  authorities via an online application and undergo a nucleic
                  acid test for COVID-19 within 48 hours of traveling to Zhuhai.
                  People receiving approval can travel across the border an
                  unlimited number of times within seven days but cannot leave
                  Guangdong. Effective June 23, 2020, nonresident workers in
                  Zhuhai entering the territory must obtain confirmation of
                  their residence from Zhuhai officials, show a green Macau
                  health code, and provide evidence of a negative COVID-19
                  nucleic acid test within seven days of entering the territory.
                  Officials will also allow some workers to enter Macau if their
                  COVID-19 test was within the past 24 hours. Macau has lifted
                  quarantine requirements for nonresident workers that live in
                  Zhuhai, Guangdong Province as of June 24, 2020. Macau
                  authorities have lifted quarantine requirements for travelers
                  from Beijing, as of July 15, 2020. The move effectively ends
                  quarantine for all inbound mainland Chinese citizens.
                  Officials also ended a requirement that arrivals with a travel
                  history in Hubei Province within the previous two weeks
                  provide evidence of negative COVID-19 status. Travelers must
                  still receive approval from Macau health authorities via an
                  online application, complete a travel and health declaration,
                  hold a green health code, and provide evidence of a negative
                  nucleic acid COVID-19 test valid for seven days. Thermal
                  scanners are in place at all entry points into Macau.
                  Travelers from mainland China can enter Macau without
                  quarantine or medical certificates proving negative COVID-19
                  status.

                  Macau is allowing residents to travel to Zhuhai, Guangdong
                  Province for official reasons, essential business activity,
                  and emergencies, without quarantine for up to 14 days.
                  Travelers must receive approval from health authorities via an
                  online application and undergo a nucleic acid test for
                  COVID-19 within 48 hours of traveling to Zhuhai. Approved
                  people can travel across the border an unlimited number of
                  times within seven days but cannot leave Guangdong. Returning
                  residents from Hong Kong must register online with the Higher
                  Education Bureau within 48 hours of their landing and plan to
                  arrive at HKG 04:00-22:00. Returning travelers from Hong Kong
                  must also provide documentation from the government and proof
                  of residency before boarding ferries for Macau.

                  immediate family members of Kuwaiti citizens traveling
                  together). Effective March 13, 2020, the Kuwait International

                  commercial flights except for arriving Kuwaiti citizens and

                  airlines to operate a limited number of outbound flights.
                  Kuwait has closed its airport and land border with Iraq.
                  Effective June 30, 2020, authorities approved plans to resume
                  commercial flights from Kuwait International Airport (KWI)
                  from August 1, 2020. But until August 1, 2020 all commercial
                  flights to and from Kuwait are indefinitely suspended.
                  Commercial flights to and from 31 countries, including but not
                  limited to Bangladesh, Egypt, Philippines, India, Sri Lanka,
                  Pakistan, Iran, and Nepal, remain suspended until further

                  countries, including mainland China, Hong Kong, and Iran.

                  Effective August 30, 2020, the nationwide nightly 21:00-03:00
                  curfew will be lifted. Per the US State Department, Kuwait
                  Ministerial Decision 288 dated March 26, 2020 gives the option
                  to foreign nationals, including US citizens, who, as of March
                  1, 2020, did not have a residence permit or whose residency
                  had expired, to depart Kuwait between April 1 and April 30,
                  2020 without paying a fine. The Ministry of Interior has
                  announced that Article 22 (dependent) and Article 24
                  (self-employed) visa holders can renew their resident permits
                  online. Residents may now also extend their temporary
                  residence visa (Article 14) online for three months for a KD 3
                  fee. The Embassy is engaging with the Kuwaiti government on
                  how Ministerial Decision 288 applies to tourist visa holders.
                  A further Ministerial Decree 355/2020 granted a temporary visa
                  extension through May 31, 2020 for individuals on all types of
                  entry visas. In addition, all tourist visas and residencies
                  are now extended through August 31, 2020. All commercial
                  flights to and from Kuwait are suspended until further notice.
                  Commercial flights from Kuwait International Airport (KWI)
                  will be resumed from August 1, 2020. Protective face coverings
                  must be worn in public. Violators may face fines or
                  imprisonment of up to three months.

                  Effective August 20, 2020, Authorities in Bahrain stopped a
                  mandatory 10-day quarantine period for all arrivals into the
                  country. Under the new measures, arrivals will be tested
                  twice, once on arrival and then 10 days later, but will be
                  able to end their self-isolation if the first test result is
                  negative. Previously, all arrivals were subject to a 10-day
                  isolation period regardless of the testing outcome.
